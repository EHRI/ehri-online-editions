				<p><!--Samuel W. Honaker, Transmitting Bulgarian Anti-Jewish Law of August 29, 1942, with Comments, Istanbul, 16.11.1942, S. 8. Records of the Department of State relating to internal affairs of Bulgaria 1910-1944, Washington 1982 (Mikrofilm-Edition): Dokument 874.4016/???.--></p>
				<p>„Reports received from <placeName ref="#sofia">Sofia</placeName> on <date when="1942-11-13">November 13, 1942</date>, indicate that
					this <term ref="#t335" type="subject">law</term> is being rigorously enforced. Previous reports that there was some lenity in the
					enforcement of the law applied only to a small number of <term ref="#t804" type="subject">Christian Jews</term> with regard to
					wearing the <term ref="#t338" type="subject">Star of David</term>. Also some postponement was found necessary due to the physical
					impossibility of moving so many <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> into the <term ref="#t545" type="subject"
						>ghetto</term> or <term ref="#t518" type="subject">deporting</term> them at one time. A prominent <term ref="#t1427"
						type="subject">Jewish surgeon</term> arrived in <placeName ref="#istanbul">Istanbul</placeName> from<placeName ref="#sofia">
						Sofia</placeName> on <date when="1942-11-12">November 12</date> after having been <term ref="#t608" type="subject">deprived of
						his right to practice his profession</term>. He owned and operated a <term ref="#t870" type="subject">hospital and
						clinic</term>, which is forbidden to <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> in accordance with Article 33 of the <term
						ref="#t335" type="subject">Law</term>. All his <term ref="#t585" type="subject">property</term> was taken away from him.
					Actually this man is a <term ref="#t767">Catholic</term> and has been such for thirty-five years. He declared that the reason for
					his severe treatment is the <term ref="#t813" type="subject">jealousy</term> of <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_bulgarians"
						>Bulgarian</term>
					<term ref="#t287" type="subject">surgeons and doctors</term> who take this means of ridding themselves of competition.</p>
				<p>As has already been mentioned several thousand <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> are now in the process of being <term
						ref="#t518" type="subject">deported</term> from <placeName ref="#sofia">Sofia</placeName>. Where they will be sent is not
					known. They are supposed to be <term ref="#t518" type="subject">deported</term> to towns and villages in <placeName
						ref="#republic-of-bulgaria">Bulgaria</placeName> but some high placed persons believe many of them will be <term ref="#t518"
						type="subject">deported</term> to <placeName ref="#republic-of-poland">Poland</placeName>. Some think they will be put in
						<term ref="#t496" type="subject">concentration camps</term> inside of <placeName
						ref="http://www.geonames.org/search?q=bulgarien&amp;country=">Bulgaria</placeName> where many will eventually die of <term
						ref="#t292" type="subject">disease</term> and <term ref="#t569" type="subject">starvation</term>. Others, including the <term
						ref="#t1427" type="subject">surgeon</term> referred to above, think that a large proportion of them will be <term ref="#t541"
						type="subject">shot</term>, as they have been in <placeName ref="#belgrade">Belgrade</placeName> and other cities. In any
					case, the content of the law, together with the severity with which it is being enforced show that its purpose is the complete
					destruction of the <term ref="#t872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> in <placeName ref="#sofia">Sofia</placeName>.“</p>
