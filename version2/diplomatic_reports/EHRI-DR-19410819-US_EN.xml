				<p>The popular <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_romanians">Rumanian</term> reaction to the recent <term ref="#t345" type="subject"
						>excesses committed against the Jews</term> is difficult of assessment. The <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_romanians"
						>Rumanians</term> have heretofore insisted upon being known as a tolerant <term ref="#t1207" type="subject">people</term>, and
					I do not doubt that the majority of them learn of the <term ref="#t540" type="subject">massacres</term> and other <term
						ref="#t345" type="subject">atrocities</term> with, possibly, a slight feeling of satisfaction, mixed with a stronger sense of
					surprise, shock and misgiving. It is undoubtedly true that the <term ref="#t342" type="subject">anti-Semitic campaign</term> of
					the <orgName ref="#ehri_dr_legionary_regime">Legionary régime</orgName>, the continual <term ref="#t341" type="subject">attacks of
						the press</term>, the present <term ref="#t1076" type="subject">military</term>
					<term ref="#t195" type="subject">collaboration</term> with <term ref="#t330" type="subject">anti-Semitic</term>
					<term ref="#t1152" type="subject">Germany</term>, and the attitude of the <term ref="#t948" type="subject">Government</term>
					during <persName ref="#p000010">General Antonescu’s</persName> absence at the front, during which time <persName ref="#p000706"
						>Mr. Mihai Antonescu</persName> has been Acting Premier, have all had their effect on <term ref="#t1072" type="subject"
						>popular opinion</term>, tending to make it especially <term ref="#t342" type="subject">anti-Semitic</term>, but I fail to
					believe that the country as a whole willingly countenances outright <term ref="#t345" type="subject">slaughter and
						brutality</term> in the handling of the <term ref="#t351" type="subject">Jewish problem</term>. [...]</p>
				<pb facs="R 6456-39 (83)" n="4"/>
				<p>But the fact remains that there has been no popular <term ref="#t212" type="subject">uprising</term> or movement against all these
						<term ref="#t345" type="subject">cruelties</term>. It may well be that the ethical sense of the <term
						ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_romanians">Rumanian</term>
					<term ref="#t1207" type="subject">people</term> has been somewhat dulled by recent miseries and disasters [...], with the result
					that they are not fully conscious of the <term ref="#t345" type="subject">horrors of the Jewish phase</term>. Whatever the cause,
					1941 has thus far proved to be a black year for the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> in <placeName ref="#romania"
						>Rumania</placeName>.</p>
				<p>My own experience is that the better class of <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_romanians">Rumanians</term> thoroughly disapproves
					of the <term ref="#t337" type="subject">methods resorted to from time to time against the Jews</term>, the <term ref="#t345"
						type="subject">cruelty</term> and the injustice. [...]</p>
				<pb facs="R 6456-39 (84)" n="5"/>
				<p>The fact remains, however, that the <term ref="#t901" type="subject">lower-class Jew</term> who has filtered into <placeName
						ref="#romania">Rumania</placeName> since the <term ref="#t1080" type="subject">War</term> from <placeName ref="#galicia"
						>Galicia</placeName>, <placeName ref="#russian-federation">Russia</placeName>, <placeName ref="#hungary">Hungary</placeName>,
						<placeName ref="#czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</placeName>, or elsewhere, and fastened upon village and small-town life is,
					by and large, not assimilable. The <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_romanians">Rumanian</term> resents his presence, although it
					is largely due to his own laissez faire that this type of <term ref="#t896" type="subject">Jew</term> is here, and, from time to
					time when things are not going well, sporadic examples of appalling <term ref="#t345" type="subject">cruelty</term> occur. The
						<term ref="#t896" type="subject">Jew</term> is always the convenient butt. Frank <placeName ref="#romania"
						>Rumanians</placeName> will admit that <term ref="#t660" type="subject">robbery</term> is often the real leit motif.</p>
