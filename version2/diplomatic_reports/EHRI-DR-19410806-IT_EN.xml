				<p>Re: <term ref="#t335" type="subject">Jews</term> against the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> in <placeName
						ref="#berlin">Hungary</placeName></p>
				<p>The <term ref="#t1076" type="subject">military</term> action against <placeName ref="#russian-federation">Russia</placeName> and
					the occupation by <placeName ref="#hungary">Hungarian</placeName> troops of a considerable part of the territory of <placeName
						ref="#galicia">Galicia</placeName> has offered Authorities here the opportunity to solve a problem that had arisen during and
					after the operations carried out by <placeName ref="#federal-republic-of-germany">Germany</placeName> in <placeName
						ref="#republic-of-poland">Poland</placeName>. A large number of <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jewish</term> elements had
					been able to filter in from <placeName ref="#republic-of-poland">Poland</placeName> and in some cases also from <placeName
						ref="#russian-federation">Russian</placeName> territory and, with the support of coreligionists living in <placeName
						ref="#hungary">Hungary</placeName>, had managed to live here practically undisturbed until now. These past weeks the
						<placeName ref="#hungary">Hungarian</placeName>
					<term ref="#t1119" type="subject">police</term> has carried out raids against the said <term ref="#t864" type="subject"
						>Semitic</term> elements who, in concert with <placeName ref="#hungary">Hungarian</placeName> and <placeName
						ref="#federal-republic-of-germany">German</placeName>
					<term ref="#t1076" type="subject">military</term> authorities, have then been conveyed to <placeName ref="#galicia"
						>Galicia</placeName>, particularly to the major towns such as <placeName ref="#kolomyia">Kolomea</placeName> and <placeName
						ref="#ivano-frankivsk">Stanislau</placeName>, where they are assigned to <term ref="#t496" type="subject">concentration
						camps</term>and <term ref="#t556" type="subject">employed</term> in excavation work, demolitions, mine clearance etc. So far,
					according to official information, the number of these <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> amounts to approx. 12,000, but
					this number will increase significantly as a recent decree has determined to extend the same measures to those <term ref="#t864"
						type="subject">Jews</term> having <placeName ref="#republic-of-poland">Polish</placeName> or <placeName
						ref="#russian-federation">Soviet</placeName>
					<term ref="#t1147" type="subject">citizenship</term><pb facs="EHRI-DR-19410806-IT_02.jpg" n="2"/> who, although they live in
						<placeName ref="#hungary">Hungary</placeName> with a proper residence permit, have not requested and obtained the <placeName
						ref="#hungary">Hungarian</placeName> citizenship during the past ten years. The only difference between these latter and those
					who have entered <placeName ref="#hungary">Magyar</placeName> territory illegally will be, it is said, that they will be allowed
					to take their personal property with them, whereas the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> transported to <placeName
						ref="#galicia">Galicia</placeName> up to now have been allowed to transfer only the sum of not more than 30 Peng√∂, equivalent
					to 120 Italian Lira. <persName ref="#ehri_dr_talamo_giuseppe">Talamo</persName>
