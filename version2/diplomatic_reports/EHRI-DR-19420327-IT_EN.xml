				<p>Re: <term ref="#t542" type="subject">Measures against the Jews</term></p>
				<p>014 - The new measures against the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> that had been announced have all of a sudden seen a
					drastic implementation. <term ref="#t872" type="subject">Ten thousand Jews</term> in towns and in villages had received personal
					summonses in order to be assembled in <term ref="#t496" type="subject">concentration camps</term>.</p>
				<p>Due to the ease with which one may convert to the <term ref="#t771" type="subject">evangelical Church</term> and because many of
					those summoned were aware that public opinion was mostly opposed to the <term ref="#t342" type="subject">anti-Semitic
						campaign</term>, and also because <term ref="#t852" type="subject">rumour</term> had it that the President of the <placeName
						ref="#slovak-republic">Republic</placeName>, Monsignor <persName ref="#p000789">Tiso</persName>, was indirectly opposed to
					such methods of persecution, many Jews did not comply with the <term ref="#t339" type="subject">orders</term> given by <persName
						ref="#p000261">Minister Mach</persName> . So in the night from 23rd to 24th March patrols formed by <term ref="#t1119"
						type="subject">police and Guardsmen</term> who had been joined by <term ref="#t1216" type="subject">SS men</term> arrived from
					over the nearby border, entered Jewish homes, seized three thousand women aged 18 to 35 years, and carried them swiftly on a lorry
					to the munitions factory in Bratislava and to the internment areas of <placeName ref="#nitra">Nitra</placeName>, <placeName
						ref="#zilina">Žilina</placeName>, <placeName ref="#presov">Prešov</placeName>, etc.</p>
				<p>The Authorities closest to the President are denying or trying to downplay the extent of the events that have clearly shaken the
					public opinion here, although everyone knows that the originator of this undertaking is <persName ref="#p000261">Minister
						Mach</persName>, Commander of the <orgName ref="#g397">Hlinka Guard</orgName>, who is being instigated by elements from beyond
					the border and by others who oppose the President, and who accuses the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> themselves of
					being responsible for everything and deserving of the worst punishments.</p>
				<p>It is well-known that the Minister of Interior, who is entirely subservient to the orders from beyond the Danube, intends to
					gradually carry out the concentration and mass deportation of all the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Israelites</term> of
						<placeName ref="#slovak-republic">Slovakia</placeName>, that is approximately 70 thousand souls, the older ones to the <term
						ref="#t1191">General Governorate of Poland</term> (<placeName ref="#lublin">Lublin</placeName> area) and the younger to
					Ukrainian locations, to be employed in farm labour and in the Organisation Todt. However, since at least for the time being they
					are mostly women still in the bloom of youth and of good social standing, no doubt their employ will be of an entirely different
					character and purpose, in the train of the German units operating in southern Russia.</p>
				<p>The announcement of harsher anti-Semitic measures had already prompted the Holy See to deliver a note to the Minister of Slovakia,
					Mister Sidor; the persecutions that have since taken place have then given rise to repeated démarches on the part of the Apostolic
					Delegate, Monsignor Burzio, with Prime Minister <persName ref="#p000413">Tuka</persName>. As things now stand, the events
					described above have caused a rift not yet made public but dangerous between Prime Minister <persName ref="#p000413"
						>Tuka</persName> and <persName ref="#p000261">Minister Mach</persName> on the one side and President <persName ref="#p000789"
						>Tiso</persName> on the other. The consequences are easy to predict if the anti-Semitic persecution should continue in the
					manner reported above and the President of the Republic, being a cleric and a parish priest with the care of souls, should sooner
					or later be faced with a serious crisis of conscience.</p>
