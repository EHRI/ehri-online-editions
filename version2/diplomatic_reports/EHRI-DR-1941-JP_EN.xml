				<p>This trip to <placeName ref="#warsaw">Warsaw</placeName> is the fourth one I undertook after the outbreak of the German-Polish
						<term ref="#t1080" type="subject">War</term> (<date when="1939-12">December 1939</date>, <date when="1940-03">March</date> and
						<date when="1940-08">August 1940</date>). I must say that my impression of the <placeName ref="#federal-republic-of-germany"
						>German</placeName> rule becomes more pessimistic each time. Namely, the <term ref="#t1072" type="subject">public
						sentiment</term> in the <term ref="#t1181" type="subject">German-occupied areas</term>, under the <term ref="#t1191"
						type="subject">General Government</term>, deteriorates more and more. The high-handed policies of the German <term
						ref="#t1032" type="subject">authorities</term>, coupled with the complex <term ref="#t918" type="subject">economic
						situation</term> particular to this area, are fanning anti-German <term ref="#t813" type="subject">sentiment among the local
						population</term>. On the other hand, the progress of the so-called rebuilding program is producing expected results thanks to
					the earnest efforts of the <term ref="#t1032" type="subject">authorities</term>. However, on the whole, its pace is extremely
					slow, and there is nothing really impressive.</p>
				<p>1a Transportation</p>
				<p>Except for the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term>, travel within the <term ref="#t1191" type="subject">General
						Government</term> is allowed. However, a special permit is required to travel between <term ref="#t1152" type="subject"
						>Germany</term> proper and the <term ref="#t1191" type="subject">General Government</term> area by those other than government
					or military personnel on official business. <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_poles">Poles</term> in principles are forbidden to

						ref="#t723" type="subject">newspaper</term> for <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> under the <term ref="#t1191"
						type="subject">General Government</term> (hence there is no <term ref="#t723" type="subject">newspaper</term> in Hebrew). </p>
				<p>Its content is roughly the same as other Polish-language <term ref="#t1069" type="subject">newspapers</term>, and mainly consists
					of articles relating to the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term>. While it publishes articles pertaining to <term
						ref="#t1191" type="subject">General Government’s</term>
					<term ref="#t1045" type="subject">policies</term> concerning <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term>, there are also sections
					on <term ref="#t679" type="subject">literature</term> and <term ref="#t824" type="subject">children</term>. In the Politics
					sections, it prints German reports without adding any commentary. </p>
				<p>To name something of interest to us, the second issue of this <term ref="#t723" type="subject">newspaper</term> published on <date
						when="1940-07-22">July 22, 1940</date> printed an item with considerable details under <q>Necessary Procedures for <term

				<p>In <placeName ref="#warsaw">Warsaw</placeName> the water supply and sewage are only partially restored. The same is with the
					telephone; although it is being partially restored, the number of its users has fallen to 1/20 of the prewar level.</p>
				<p>The streets are still full of collapsed houses from artillery attacks by the German <term ref="#t1077" type="subject">army</term>
					and chaotic. Moreover, as many human and <term ref="#t811" type="subject">animal</term><term ref="#t515" type="subject"
						>corpses</term> are buried under the rubbles, the city shrouded in a certain stench. In <date when="1940-03">March 1940</date>
					I saw dead horses in the middle of the street; now they are gone.</p>
				<p>Immediately after the war in <date from="1939-09-01" notAfter="1939-10-06">1939</date> plans were drawn up to move <term
						ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> to the east and to rebuild urban <placeName ref="#warsaw">Warsaw</placeName>.
					Concerning the former, no further concrete decisions have been revealed and the plan has been shelved; as for the latter, except
					the opening of a few news streets, it appears the plan has been grounded. It can be imagined rebuilding has many difficulties
					ahead. </p>
				<p><placeName ref="#lublin">Lublin</placeName> and its vicinity were designated as area of <term ref="#t864" type="subject"
						>Jewish</term> residence. However, subsequently no movement of <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> from <placeName
						ref="#warsaw">Warsaw</placeName> and the <placeName ref="#krakow">Krakow</placeName> region have taken place. This plan seems
					to have been abolished. There has been no rebuilding or restoration in <placeName ref="#lublin">Lublin</placeName>. Water supply
					and sewage are being restored in <placeName ref="#krakow">Krakow</placeName>, where rebuilding effort has developed the
					furthest.</p>
				<p>1o. Summary</p>
				<p>While the rebuilding efforts have just started under the <term ref="#t1191" type="subject">General Government</term> as stated
					above, given the abundant <term ref="#t488" type="subject">labor force</term> and the superior organizational capacity of the
						<term ref="#t1032" type="subject">authorities</term>, the efforts should bear fruit. At the party congress held in <placeName
						ref="#krakow">Krakow</placeName> at the beginning of <date when="1941">1941</date>
					<persName ref="#p000124">Governor General Dr. Frank</persName> outlined major rebuilding projects for <date when="1941"
						>1941</date> and underscored their importance. This plan includes the dredging of the <placeName ref="#vistula">Vistula
						River</placeName>, re-organization of <term ref="#t937" type="subject">industries</term>, and building of <term ref="#t837"
						type="subject">housing</term> and roads.</p>
