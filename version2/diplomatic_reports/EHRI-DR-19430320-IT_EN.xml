				<p><term ref="#t330" type="subject">Measures</term> against the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> of <placeName
						ref="#thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</placeName>.</p>
				<p>On the 12th inst. the Jewsâ€™ <term ref="#t518" type="subject">departure</term> for <placeName ref="#republic-of-poland"
						>Poland</placeName> has begun. Four <term ref="#t522" type="subject">trains</term> are planned each week, and each train will
					hold approx. 2,500 people. At this rate, within 5 or 6 weeks all <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> will have left
					town.</p>
				<p>The beginning of the <term ref="#t575" type="subject">transfer</term> and the way in which it is carried out, i.e. more than 60
					people in each freight car, with very few clothes and little food and with <term ref="#t585" type="subject">no money and
						valuables</term>, has caused deep dismay among the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term>, who in their great majority
					deluded themselves that they would escape such a measure.</p>
				<p>The <placeName ref="#hellenic-republic">Greek</placeName> population, in general, <term ref="#t813" type="subject"
						>disapproves</term> of the severity with which the measures are carried out and is touched by what they see happening.</p>
				<p>Among the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> there is <term ref="#t173" type="subject">resentment</term> against the
						<placeName ref="#hellenic-republic">Greeks</placeName>, because a <term ref="#t852" type="subject">rumour</term> has spread
					that the <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_germans" type="subject">Germans</term> have acted at the request of a <placeName
						ref="#hellenic-republic">Greek</placeName> committee that is said to have travelled to <placeName ref="#nuernberg"
						>Nurnberg</placeName> for this purpose, some time ago.</p>
				<p>During the departure operations, which have to be completed within a very short time, <term ref="#t345" type="subject">acts of
						violence</term> have occurred that have left an unfavourable impression. There have been several demises <pb
						facs="EHRI-DR-19430320-IT_02.jpg" n="2"/> on the way from the <term ref="#t545" type="subject">ghetto</term> to the railway
					station.</p>
				<p>As soon as the Jews left their neighbourhood, gangs of <placeName ref="#hellenic-republic">Greek</placeName>
					<term ref="#t527" type="subject">criminals</term> broke into their homes in order to plunder them. The Greek <term ref="#t1124"
						type="subject">gendarmerie</term> had to step in and resorted to firearms. Four thieves were killed, four more were fatally
					wounded, approx. 35 were wounded and about a hundred were arrested. <term ref="#t1032" type="subject">German authorities</term>
					have issued very harsh <term ref="#t542" type="subject">orders</term> whereby anyone entering a deserted <term ref="#t864"
						type="subject">Jewish</term> home will be shot on the spot.</p>
				<p><term ref="#t1215" type="subject">The rebels</term> have sent agents into the <term ref="#t545" type="subject">ghetto</term>, to
					make <term ref="#t986" type="subject">propaganda</term> and to recruit more easily people for their bands. They do this very
					prudently, for fear of being found out,</p>
				<p>Some people have indeed fled, either <term ref="#t248" type="subject">to join the rebels</term> or to reach our zone, but their
					number is as yet unknown.</p>
				<p>Town life continues to be overshadowed by this event, which has engendered situations that will find their solution only in the
					course of time.</p>
