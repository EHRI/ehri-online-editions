				<p>“I have the honor to refer to paragraph 1, section c, of my telegram No. 39, <date when="1938-03-29">March 29, 1938</date>, 5 p.m.,
					regarding a proposed <term ref="#t950" type="subject">bill</term> to limit ritual slaughter in <placeName
						ref="#republic-of-poland">Poland</placeName> and to report that a new <term ref="#t950" type="subject">bill</term> calling for
					a gradual diminution of <term ref="#ehri_dr_ritual_slaughter">ritual slaughter</term> over the next three years has just passed
					the Committee of the <orgName ref="#ehri_dr_sejm">Sejm</orgName> and awaits presentation to that body as a whole. […]</p>
				<p>In discussing with the <term ref="#t895" type="subject">leaders of various Jewish groups</term> their reactions, I gained the
					impression that it is mainly the orthodox, and even amongst their number the more strictly religious, who, from a <term
						ref="#t726" type="subject">religious angle</term> are seriously concerned over the prospect of eventually doing away with
						<term ref="#ehri_dr_ritual_slaughter">ritual slaughter</term>. Others, such as the <term ref="#t907" type="subject"
						>Zionists</term>, and the Zionist Revisionists, and particularly the <term ref="#t1203" type="subject">youth</term> thereof,
					are less concerned by the <term ref="#t950" type="subject">bill’s</term> potential effect on <term ref="#ehri_dr_ritual_slaughter"
						>ritual slaughter</term> than by the prospect of the <term ref="#t950" type="subject">bill’s</term> presaging further <term
						ref="#t337" type="subject">anti-Semitic measures</term>. One prominent member of the Zionist Revisionist inner circles
					imparted his opinion that the <term ref="#t950" type="subject">bill</term> was aimed mainly as <term ref="#t342" type="subject"
						>propaganda</term> to force the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> of all categories in <placeName
						ref="#republic-of-poland">Poland</placeName> to unite in support of the <term ref="#t948" type="subject">Government</term>
					search for a solution of the <term ref="#t351" type="subject">Jewish problem</term>, mainly in terms of <term ref="#t203"
						type="subject">emigration</term>. […]</p>
				<p>My own observation led me to believe that contributing to the <term ref="#t950" type="subject">bill’s</term> proposal there are the
					following military and social aspects: military, in that the <term ref="#t1077" type="subject">Army’s</term> long-range program
					envisages the eventual centralization of meat control and refrigeration to meet emergency periods; and socially, in that the
					racial <placeName ref="#republic-of-poland">Polish</placeName> peasant wants to replace the <term ref="#t864" type="subject"
						>Jew</term> in the meat <term ref="#t924" type="subject">business</term>. As to the prospects of the <term ref="#t950"
						type="subject">bill’s</term> amendment, this, in my opinion, will depend largely upon the <term ref="#t948" type="subject"
						>Government’s</term>
					<term ref="#t815" type="subject">attitude</term> in general towards the <term ref="#t351" type="subject">Jewish question</term>.
					At the moment, I do not look for the <term ref="#t950" type="subject">bill</term> to be rejected.”</p>
