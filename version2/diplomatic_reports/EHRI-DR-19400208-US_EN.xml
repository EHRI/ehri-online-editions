				<p>The <orgName ref="#g423">Jewish authorities</orgName> in <placeName ref="#berlin">Berlin</placeName> who are competent only for
						<term ref="#t1159" type="subject">Reich</term> territory have little precise <term ref="#t220" type="subject"
						>information</term> concerning <term ref="#t831" type="subject">conditions</term> in <placeName ref="#republic-of-poland"
						>Poland</placeName> although the following is their understanding of the situation in that area based upon such meager
					reliable date as they have been able to obtain:</p>
				<p>A mass <term ref="#t575" type="subject">transfer of the Jews</term> in the <placeName ref="#katowice">Kattowitz</placeName> region
					which was threatened has been postponed at least until <date when="1940-03">March</date>. It is not known here to what extent the
						<term ref="#t575" type="subject">transfer of Jews</term> from other regions is still being carried out under present
					conditions although it is understood that considerable numbers of <pb facs="EHRI-DR-19400208_02.jpg" n="2"/>
					<term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> are being expelled from <placeName ref="#lodz">Lodz</placeName> and are being sent
					east. The situation of the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> appears to be at its worst in the vicinity of <placeName
						ref="#lublin">Lublin</placeName> where it is said that they are being subjected to particularly brutal <term ref="#t601"
						type="subject">treatment </term>by the <term ref="#t360" type="subject">party</term>
					<term ref="#t1216" type="subject">SS</term> Guards. It is also stated that <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> have been
					sent to <placeName ref="#lublin">Lublin</placeName> in unheated <term ref="#t940" type="subject">trains</term> with the result
					that cases of freezing to death have been reported. [...]</p>
				<pb facs="EHRI-DR-19400208_03.jpg" n="3"/>
				<p>While reports which are mostly second hand are received in sufficient quantity to demonstrate that unquestionably great suffering
					is being endured by the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> and by large groups of <term
						ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_poles">Poles</term> it is pointed out in local <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_germans"
						>German</term> circles that the current hardships, which on the one hand are inevitable as a result of the military campaign
					and of the redistribution of [Auslassung in der Originalvorlage], pale by comparison with those which existed in <placeName
						ref="#republic-of-poland">Poland</placeName> following the last war and that on the other hand some of the stern measures now
					being taken by the <term ref="#t1032" type="subject">German authorities</term> are necessary for the purpose of eliminating the
						<term ref="#t527" type="subject">criminal elements</term> released from <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_poles">Polish</term>
					<term ref="#t651" type="subject">jails</term> at the beginning of the war and for the restoration of order following the <pb
