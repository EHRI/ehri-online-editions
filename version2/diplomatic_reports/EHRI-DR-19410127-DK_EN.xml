				<p>Doc. 2</p>
				<p>Mr. <persName ref="#ehri_dr_scavenius_erik">Foreign minister</persName>,</p>
				<p>Through the <placeName ref="#hungary">Hungarian</placeName>
					<term ref="#t850" type="subject">National Radio Broadcasts</term>, it was announced that, in mid-January, the Prime Minister,
					General <persName ref="#p000010">Antonescu</persName>, had been on a 1-day visit with Chancellor <persName ref="#p000185"
						>Hitler</persName>. In <placeName ref="#bucharest">Bucharest</placeName> was the meeting not officially mentioned, and
					therefore gave rise to some remarkable rumours.</p>
				<p>A few days after the General’s return, a <orgName ref="#g005004">German General Staff Officer</orgName>, <persName
						ref="#ehri_dr_doering_helmut">Major Döring</persName>, was murdered on the street in Bucharest. The killer is said to be a man
					with a <placeName ref="#hellenic-republic">Greek</placeName> name, <persName ref="#ehri_dr_sarandos_dimitrie">Dimitrie
						Sarandos</persName>, who had come from <placeName ref="#united-states">America</placeName> with a <placeName
						ref="#republic-of-turkey">Turkish</placeName> passport and whose profession is stated as being a wrestler.</p>
				<p>The cause of the <term ref="#t532" type="subject">murder</term> has so far not been resolved; officials say that they are still
					investigating the crime.</p>
				<p>However, this resulted in General <persName ref="#p000010">Antonescu’s</persName> dismissal of the <orgName ref="#g454"
						>legionary</orgName>
					<orgName ref="#g006363">Minister of the Interior</orgName>, <persName ref="#ehri_dr_petrovicescu_constantin">General
						Petrovicescu</persName>, who was accused of not taking immediate action for a thorough investigation. The Legionary <term
						ref="#t1068" type="subject">Press</term> protested against this dismissal, while at the same time emphasizing its strong
					association with the <term ref="#t1027" type="subject">Axis Powers</term>, calling for revenge on those who stood behind the
					killer.</p>
				<p>It can thus be concluded, that the murder was not aimed at the <term ref="#t1028" type="subject">presence of the Axis</term> in
						<placeName ref="#romania">Romania</placeName>, as Romanian Patriots suggested it in a <placeName
						ref="#united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland">British</placeName> Radio broadcasts, since the warring parties
					agree that only the Axis military precautions in Romania save them from further segregation between their hostile neighbours.</p>
				<pb facs="EHRI-DR-19410127_02.jpg" n="2"/>
				<p>One could not fail to notice that the Press controlled by the Legionnaires made <term ref="#t989" type="subject">propaganda</term>
					for the Revolution, i.e. further looting of the possessive classes and especially of the <term ref="#t864" type="subject"
						>Jews</term> and new members of the <term ref="#t1204" type="subject">Freemasons</term>.</p>
				<p>Finally, it was clear to the Prime Minister that he ruled with some Ministers in one direction, i.e. on the basis of the existence
					of evolutionary development, while the Deputy Prime Minister, <orgName ref="#g454">Legionary</orgName> Commander <persName
						ref="#p000375">Horia Sima</persName> with other Ministers, ruled towards a Revolution and immediate looting and destruction of
					everything of endurance. The situation was unsustainable and as a first serious countermeasure from the Prime Minister’s site
					emerged on 21 of this month a decree abolishing the main efforts of the Legionnaires to <ref
						target="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/niod-trefwoorden-militarisering">militarize</ref> the Romanian institutions as
					well as important State enterprises. I have reported this in my above-mentioned report.</p>
				<p>The answer to this relatively peaceful act was that the Legionary Party on the 22 of this month occupied a police barrack with 600
					men, located right next to the <orgName ref="#g003224">Foreign Ministry</orgName>, where the Prime Minister has his Bureau as well
					as his temporary residence. Thus, the <term ref="#t254" type="subject">rebellion</term> had begun.</p>
				<p>It soon became clear that the Legionnaires were well supplied with <term ref="#t1095" type="subject">rifles and ammunition</term>,
					and that they had prepared the action by <term ref="#t660" type="subject">pre-occupying</term> houses taken from <term ref="#t888"
						type="subject">wealthy Jews</term> in all districts. The garrison commanded by General <persName ref="#p000010"
						>Antonescu</persName>, finally succeeded in capturing the Police barrack, from which the Legionnaires attacked the Foreign
					Ministry with the purpose of killing the General.</p>
				<p>On the first day, the military sought to avoid shooting and trusted the effect of their sole appearance. However, as <term
						ref="#t1097" type="subject">Soldier</term> everywhere where shot down, during the course of the second day, a common battle
					erupted throughout the city, during which the military, with guns, tanks and machine guns, damaged the fortified houses of the
					Legionnaires.</p>
				<pb facs="EHRI-DR-19410127_03.jpg" n="3"/>
				<p>There were many dead and wounded on both sides, but we do not know how many. However, the number of victims is hardly proportional
					to the periodic violent cannonade that lasted all day and night for more than 2 days.</p>
				<p>All this time, Legionnaire gangs carried out gruesome <term ref="#t346" type="subject">pogroms</term>, notably against the <term
						ref="#t902" type="subject">Jewish Proletariat</term> in the suburbs, where large-scale <term ref="#t536" type="subject"
						>assassinations</term> and looting took place.</p>
				<p>In short, the vast majority of the so fiercely proclaimed <orgName ref="#g454">Legionary Movement</orgName> people, i.e. The dregs
					of the City, took the opportunity to show who they really were, without the so-called leadership being able to limit the struggle
					to its true purpose, which was the creation of a pure Legionary government under <persName ref="#p000375">Horia
					Sima</persName>.</p>
				<p>Following the culmination of the Romanian Military’s efforts early on <date when="1941-01-23">Thursday (the 23<hi rend="sup"
							>rd</hi></date>), <persName ref="#p000375">Horia Sima</persName> sent out, via Radio and leaflets, an <term ref="#t1085"
						type="subject">order</term> to the Legionnaires to put down the weapons.</p>
				<p>The fighters only partially complied with the order, but in the course of the afternoon, at least, they succeeded in establishing
					peace while motorized divisions of the present <orgName ref="#g438">German Armed Forces</orgName> demonstratively drove through
					the city obviously prepared to assist the Romanian military if necessary.</p>
				<p>By Friday morning, the uprising was <term ref="#t255" type="subject">dissolved</term> and the entire city occupied by the Romanian
					Military, which began searching for the Legionnaires’ hidden abode and large quantities of stolen goods distributed over many
					houses have since been brought to light.</p>
				<p>Undoubtedly, the entire Rebellion has been planned and staged by General <persName ref="#p000010">Antonescu’s</persName> closest
					Employees in the Legionary State’s leadership.</p>
				<p>The <orgName ref="#g004809">police</orgName> were searching for Deputy Prime Minister <persName ref="#p000375">Horia
						Sima</persName> and it is said that he has been arrested today.</p>
				<p>The appointment of a general government was generally expected, but so far, nothing has been published regarding the transformation
					of the government, let alone its dismissal.</p>
				<p>In reality, it is fair to say that the country is currently administered solely the Governor, General <persName ref="#p000010"
						>Antonescu</persName>, currently administers the country with the help of the declared state of emergency.</p>
				<pb facs="EHRI-DR-19410127_04.jpg" n="4"/>
				<p><term ref="#t1117" type="subject">Intelligence</term> from the Province suggests that rebellions of the same kind as here have been
					common in the larger cities, while the rural population itself has turned against the plans of the Legionnaires.</p>
				<p>After the rebellion, General <persName ref="#p000010">Antonescu</persName> issued a comprehensive Proclamation to the People. The
						<persName ref="#p000010">general</persName> thanked the Army for its courage, describing the suffering he went through before
					it became inevitable to shoot at the people, he declares that from now on he will personally take charge of the youth’s education
					and that all who are guilty will be <term ref="#t950" type="subject">punished</term>.</p>
				<p>General Disarmament will now be implemented by the Military.</p>
				<p>The Romanians here have stated to me that the proclamation is well suited to make an impression, especially within the large
					Romanian peasant population, but at the same time, it is found to be too lyrical and weak to deter future troublemakers.</p>
				<p>Especially regarding the last point, it is apparent that the <persName ref="#p000010">general</persName> now faces a number of
					challenges in setting up a new Ministry, but the situation is still too unclear to be overlooked.</p>
				<p>H.m. <persName ref="#p001425">King Mihai</persName> and the Royal family have before and during the rebellion period stayed in
						<placeName ref="#sinaia">Sinaia</placeName> without being directly involved in the events, as far as we know here in
					Bucharest.</p>
				<p>With the honourable mention, I have the honour to remain <persName ref="#ehri_dr_scavenius_erik">Mr. Foreign Minister’s</persName>
					most reverent,</p>
				<p><persName ref="#ehri_dr_biering_erik_andreas_mathias">Erik Biering</persName></p>
