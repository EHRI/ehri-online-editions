				<p>Re: Measures against the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Israelites</term> of Macedonia.</p>
				<p/>
				<p>At 12 midnight of the 10th inst., while troops were blocking the streets of <placeName ref="#skopje">Skopje</placeName>, groups of
						<term ref="#t1120" type="subject">policemen</term> began to knock at the door of the homes of <term ref="#t864" type="subject"
						>Israelite</term> families asking them to pack a limited amount of baggage as they were to be taken to a <term ref="#t496"
						type="subject">concentration camp</term> set up in the <ref
						target="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-jewishcouncil-organisation-jmp-36">warehouses</ref> of the tobacco
					depository and in the surrounding, fenced-in land. At 6 pm on the 11th the street blockade was lifted and 5,000 <term ref="#t864"
						type="subject">Jews</term> had already been taken to the <term ref="#t496" type="subject">concentration camp</term>, while the
						<term ref="#t641" type="subject">hunt</term> for the few who had managed to hide or who were roaming the countryside intending
					to cross into <placeName ref="#republic-of-albania">Albania</placeName> was continuing. Other similar police operations were under
					way at the same time in <placeName ref="#bitola">Bitola</placeName> and in other <placeName ref="#north-macedonia"
						>Macedonian</placeName> towns, leading to the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Israelite</term> there being taken to
						<placeName ref="#skopje">Skopje</placeName>, where the number of <term ref="#t618" type="subject">concentrated people</term>
					has now risen to over 9,000. The lengthy examination of their <term ref="#t621" type="subject">documents</term> and of their
					baggage and the painstaking body searches will be followed, reportedly within a few days, by <term ref="#t518" type="subject"
						>deportation</term> to a far-away Country, that it is believed will be <placeName ref="#republic-of-poland">Poland</placeName>
					for the majority and for some perhaps <placeName ref="#kingdom-of-belgium">Belgium</placeName> or <placeName ref="#l220"
						>Germany</placeName>.</p>
				<p>It has been a blanket action both as regards people and as regards <term ref="#t887" type="subject">property</term>: even <term
						ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> of extremely advanced age or with a serious health condition have been forced to leave
					their homes and were taken to the <term ref="#t567" type="subject">camp</term> on rough carts, while their homes with all their
					contents were declared State property and even what little they had been allowed to take with them was later further restricted.
					They have each been left with only the oldest <term ref="#t836" type="subject">garment</term> and the oldest shoes <pb
						facs="EHRI-DR-19430316-IT_02.jpg" n="1"/>they had brought with them, and the search for gold and money about the persons of
					the <term ref="#t618" type="subject">concentrated people</term> has enabled officials, <term ref="#t1120" type="subject"
						>policemen</term> and <term ref="#t1097" type="subject">soldiers</term> to walk off with all they could still lay their hands
					on: even scraps of soap, used toothbrushes and almost empty tubes of toothpaste have been taken away from these unfortunate people
					who may truly be said to have be left with only their eyes to weep with.</p>
				<p>Added to the worries about their entirely uncertain future and to the pain for the total loss of all <term ref="#t887"
						type="subject">property</term>, the 9,000 people about to be <term ref="#t518" type="subject">deported</term> face absolutely
					unnecessary hardships that are inflicted on them due to lack of foresight or to mere brutality. The most basic sanitary
					facilities, which at first were lacking almost entirely, are only now beginning to work but still only inadequately, <term
						ref="#t832" type="subject">food</term> is very scarce and unsuitable (during the first days they gave out, even to babies only
					a few months old, some thin bean slops without any bread), the <term ref="#t286" type="subject">guards</term> seize on any pretext
					to use with sadistic force the whips they carry, while the crowding of all sorts of people within a cramped space renders rest all
					but impossible. The tragic but logical consequence of all this are suicides – as far as I know there have been at least three so
					far – and, particularly among women, instances of hysterical agitation bordering on insanity.</p>
				<p>According to what <orgName ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_bulgarians">Bulgarians</orgName> are saying, the total elimination of <term
						ref="#t864" type="subject">Israelite</term> from <placeName ref="#north-macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> has been requested by
						<placeName ref="#l220">Germany</placeName> for military reasons: there can be no doubt, however, that they have made
					excellent, huge gains out of it, and that in carrying it out the have displayed the most total disregard for even the most basic
					humanitarian principles. I do not hesitate to claim that there are very few people who, being present in <placeName ref="#skopje"
						>Skopje</placeName> on 11th March and having seen the manner in which the Israelite families were being taken to the <term
						ref="#t496" type="subject">concentration camp</term> and having then heard how they were being treated, have not felt a sense
					of pity for those thus stricken and of deep condemnation of the Bulgarian authorities responsible for this and for their
					agents.</p>
				<p>As for the Italian Israelite Modiano family]and the families of Israelites who are Albanian nationals in <placeName ref="#skopje"
						>Skopje</placeName> and have been taken to the <term ref="#t496" type="subject">concentration camp</term>, presumably 9
					families with approx. 25 members, I have already reported with telegram no. 409/88 of the 14th March inst. and I intend to report
					further.</p>
