                <p><placeName ref="#prague" type="ehri">Na Bašte sv. Ludmily 19</placeName>.</p>

                <p>My dear ones,</p>
                <p>this time, as an exception, I am writing you in German. For this <term ref="#t843" type="subject">letter</term>, which will
                    probably be very long, is not just for our dear friends who have written so cordially to us – that is, for Anny, Josef, Alfred,
                    the <persName ref="#ehri_et_wintesteins" type="ehri">Wintersteins</persName> – but also for all the many others, some of whom may
                    not be able to read Czech, others not English. Don’t be angry that I report so collectively. But it is not only technically, but
                    also emotionally a very difficult task to keep telling these terrible things again and again.</p>
                <p>Before I report about us, I want to narrate in general about <placeName ref="#l449" type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName>.
                    Because that is where we left most of our common <term ref="#t196" type="subject">friends</term> in <date when="1944-05">May
                        1944</date>, whom we unfortunately have mostly not seen again. You will have heard and read more than enough about <term
                        ref="#t496" type="subject">concentration camps</term>. You probably don’t know much about <placeName ref="#l449" type="ghetto"
                        >Theresienstadt</placeName>, but it was very bad. Especially because if our people had had some good will, it could have
                    become a very tolerable social construct. We really had <term ref="#t2" type="subject">self-administration</term>, it was
                    absolutely not a <term ref="#t496" type="subject">concentration camp</term>. But as it was, it became a morass of corruption and
                    arbitratiness. There were 3 very clearly distinguished castes: 1./ The <q><term ref="#t484" type="subject">prominent
                            persons</term></q> (this is not ridicule, but <q><term ref="#t484" type="subject">die Prominenten</term></q> was the
                    official designation), their favorites, and their hangers-on. – 2./ The hard <term ref="#t943" type="subject">workers</term>,
                    including <term ref="#t1427" type="subject">doctors</term> and caregivers. – 3./ The old and those unable to <term ref="#t556"
                        type="subject">work</term>. – The first group lived in luxury and, above all, was protected from the feared <term ref="#t521"
                        type="subject">transports</term> to unknown destinations. – The second group earned money with great difficulty, but at any
                    rate acquired its piece of <term ref="#t832" type="subject">bread</term> and was not all too <term ref="#t569" type="subject"
                        >hungry</term>, if never entirely sated. – The third group <term ref="#t570" type="subject">starved</term> already in
                        <placeName ref="#l449" type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName>, if they had no connections to Group 1. – So only one segment
                    had it really bad there. But the people behaved as if everything was a matter of life and death, like in the <term ref="#t496"
                        type="subject">concentration camp</term>, completely ruthlessly and demoralized. I can say with pride that our mutual friends
                    were among the very few left to the old, Dr. <persName ref="#ehri_et_lederer_beers" type="ehri">Lederer-Beers</persName>, Dr.

                    don’t know about Igel and Rita. But both were very <term ref="#t292" type="subject">ill</term>. – Most of these <term ref="#t196"
                        type="subject">friends</term> did not come to <placeName ref="#l0" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName> until <date
                        when="1944-10">October 44</date>. At this time, one <q><term ref="#t484" type="subject">prominent person</term></q> after the

                    then. –The returned <term ref="#t287" type="subject">doctors</term> probably have good prospects of opening private practices, but
                    a managing position in a <term ref="#t282" type="subject">hospital</term> is out of the question. I am very curious whether and
                    how you have decided. Unfortunately there is hardly any hope, dear Anny, that Sidy will turn up. I was often together with her in
                        <placeName ref="#l449" type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName>. She looked good and well cared for, had an easy, profitable
                    position as seamstress in the <term ref="#t315" type="subject">children’s home</term>, and lived relatively very well. I don’t
                    know when she left.</p>
                <p>We were in <placeName ref="#l449" type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName> from <date when="1942-09">Sept. 42</date> to <date
                        when="1944-05">May 44</date>. Aside from the generally depressing <term ref="#t831" type="subject">conditions</term>, we had
                    terrible private misfortune: we came immediately in the <term ref="#t521" type="subject">transports</term> to <placeName
                        ref="#republic-of-poland" type="ehri">Poland</placeName>. Lissi came down with a severe <term ref="#t492" type="subject"
                        >scarlet fever</term> and then <term ref="#t492" type="subject">jaundice</term>, so that she lay for 3 months in the <term
                        ref="#t282" type="subject">hospital</term>, <term ref="#t569" type="subject">hungry</term> and miserable. This misfortune was
                    our good fortune, because it meant we <term ref="#t204" type="subject">escaped</term> the <term ref="#t521" type="subject"
                        >transports</term>. But my <term ref="#t822" type="subject">father</term>, Irka, and Lore, and many friends had to <term
                        ref="#t745" type="subject">die</term>. –We were all three heavy <term ref="#t943" type="subject">laborers</term>. I worked in
                    the laundry, Lissi as a <term ref="#t286" type="subject">nurse</term> on the <term ref="#t282" type="subject">infections
                        ward</term>, Franzi in <term ref="#t932" type="subject">agriculture</term>. In Spring <date when="1943">43</date>, Erwin and
                    Lizzi came to <placeName ref="#l449" type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName>. Lizzi worked with me in the laundry, was brave,
                    hardworking, and indescribably goodhearted. At <term ref="#t754" type="subject">Pentecost</term>
                    <date when="1943">43</date> a terrible misfortune happened. Franzi, who had had an unexplained <term ref="#t292" type="subject"
                        >fever</term> for weeks – probably an undiagnosed <term ref="#t492" type="subject">scarlet fever</term> – <term ref="#t217"
                        type="subject">jumped</term> one night from the 2nd upper storey of her barracks and lay there with a broken pelvis and
                    smashed ankles. She had no reason at all to do this. We lived in the best harmony, and she had a magnificent fiance, whom she
                    loved very much. She was suspended between life and death for a half a year. She got <term ref="#t493" type="subject">typhoid
                        fever</term> as well. But this misfortune was our good fortune, too. We were in the <term ref="#t521" type="subject"
                        >transport</term> again, and again we got out of it. But Lizzi, Erwin, Franzi's boy went and were <term ref="#t132"
                        type="subject">lost</term>. Franzi recovered, despite all the predictions of the <term ref="#t1427" type="subject"
                        >doctors</term>, and is more beautiful and in better condition than ever, she's just easily fatigued. So we didn’t come to
                        <placeName ref="#l0" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName> until May 44. We were glad to go, because we looked forward to seeing
                    our loved ones, and of course we didn’t know that it was <placeName ref="#l0" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName>. We learned
                    immediately that they were all <term ref="#t745" type="subject">dead</term>. Franzi withstood this shock wonderfully, Lissi less
                    so. I had to be brave for all three of us. Our <term ref="#t521" type="subject">transport</term> was the first that was mustered

                        >Germany</placeName>, about 2 months after our arrival. Of course, I was rejected because I looked terrible. But I came along
                    anyway and so we were <term ref="#t521" type="subject">transported</term> to <placeName ref="#l450" type="camp"
                        >Christianstadt</placeName>, <placeName ref="#federal-republic-of-germany" type="ehri">Germany's</placeName> biggest munitions
                        <term ref="#t929" type="subject">factory</term>. This was a subdivision of the <term ref="#t496" type="subject">concentration
                        camp</term>
                    <placeName ref="#l433" type="camp">Gross-Rosen</placeName>. Until the Fall, we maintained more or less. But with the <term
                        ref="#t831" type="subject">cold</term>, our <term ref="#t569" type="subject">hunger</term> became intolerable. And when we
                    were <term ref="#t623" type="subject">evacuated</term> at the beginning of <date when="1945-02">February 45</date>, it got
                    catastrophic. On the third day of this miserable <term ref="#t517" type="subject">hike</term>, the <term ref="#t824"
                        type="subject">children</term> and I resolved we would rather be <term ref="#t532" type="subject">shot dead</term> trying to
                        <term ref="#t204" type="subject">escape</term> than exhausted at the side of the road. We were not <term ref="#t532"
                        type="subject">shot dead</term>. We went without <term ref="#t569" type="subject">bread</term>, without papers, <term
                        ref="#t836" type="subject">clothed</term> in shreds of rags right through <placeName ref="#federal-republic-of-germany"
                        type="ehri">Germany</placeName> on the border between <placeName ref="#silesia" type="ehri">Silesia</placeName> and <placeName
                        ref="#brandenburg" type="ehri">Brandenburg</placeName>, always eastward toward the sun and the thunder of the artillery on the
                    nearby front, toward the <orgName ref="#g004583" type="ehri">Russians</orgName>. / The other <term ref="#t304" type="subject"
                        >refugees</term> had turned to the West, away from the front. / <term ref="#t637" type="subject">Farmers</term> took pity on
                    us and let us spend the night in the cattle stall, as we asked, and <pb facs="EHRI-ET-YV9392546_03.jpg" n="3"/> gave us <term
                        ref="#t832" type="subject">food</term>, which we never had to ask for. On the 6th day we found ourselves in the middle of the
                        <term ref="#t1082" type="subject">German front</term> fleeing from <placeName ref="#wroclaw" type="ehri">Breslau</placeName>.
                    In this dire danger, when a single call would cost us our lives, the only <term ref="#t767" type="subject">Catholic church</term>
                    in the whole area was the first building that <term ref="#t261" type="subject">opened its doors</term> to us. The <term
                        ref="#t734" type="subject">priest</term>, whom we told the whole story, took us in and <term ref="#t262" type="subject"
                        >hid</term> us, even though he had <term ref="#t633" type="subject">Germans quartered</term> in the building. We received from
                    him and the others in the building wonderful, warm quarters, fantastic <term ref="#t569" type="subject">food</term>, linens, <term
                        ref="#t836" type="subject">clothed</term>, and shoes; they did all this so cheerfully and as a matter of course, even though
                    they themselves were in need and danger. This change from darkness to light was our most staggering experience of these years.</p>
                <p>After a week, the <orgName ref="#g004583" type="ehri">Russians</orgName> were there. After 7 weeks, we had recovered enough to work
                    as members of the <orgName ref="#g004583" type="ehri">Red Army</orgName> as linens seamstresses in the <term ref="#t1076"
                        type="subject">military</term>
                    <term ref="#t549" type="subject">workshops</term>, i.e., we traveled along barely behind the front, where we had lots of work, but
                    wonderful treatment and plenty of <term ref="#t569" type="subject">food</term>. At the end of <date when="1945-04">April</date>,
                    we joined a column of people returning to <placeName ref="#czechoslovakia" type="ehri">Czechoslovakia</placeName> and arrived in
                        <placeName ref="#ostrava" type="ehri">Ostrau</placeName> in mid-<date when="1945-06">June</date> after a march of 350
                    kilometers.</p>
                <p>Franzi soon moved to <placeName ref="#prague" type="ehri">Prague</placeName>; she is an assistant to <persName
                        ref="#ehri_et_ziffer_erich" type="ehri">Erich Ziffer</persName>, who returned from <placeName ref="#russian-federation"
                        type="ehri">Russia</placeName>. They lost their <term ref="#t822" type="subject">son</term>, who was a <orgName ref="#g004583"
                        type="ehri">Russian soldier</orgName>. Lissi finished her old <term ref="#t1132" type="subject">high school</term> within 3
                    months, took her final examination with honors and has matriculated at the <term ref="#t1132" type="subject">Technical
                        University</term> here to become an engineer. She already knows the required languages – Spanish and Russian in addition to
                    those learned at the <term ref="#t1132" type="subject">school</term>. Both <term ref="#t824" type="subject">children</term>
                    learned Russian at my wish back then in <placeName ref="#prague" type="ehri">Prague</placeName>, and that <term ref="#t214"
                        type="subject">rescued</term> us. Because otherwise we wouldn’t have risked fleeing toward the <orgName ref="#g004583"
                        type="ehri">Russians</orgName>. –So we have been in <placeName ref="#prague" type="ehri">Prague</placeName> for 14 days now.
                    We have strenuous months behind us trying to replace our destroyed documents. Our name is now <persName ref="#ehri_et_sorkova"

                <p>We can’t think about <term ref="#t203" type="subject">emigrating</term> now, this is not allowed because of the shortage of
                    workers. We thank you all, especially you, dear Rufus, for your willingness to help, just as we must thank Samek and <persName

                    would mean a lot, especially cigarettes. –Soci and Marta, don’t be angry that I'm not answering you separately. We have conveyed
                    your wishes. Dear Dr. <persName ref="#ehri_et_boehm_erich" type="ehri">Erich Böhm</persName>, your cottage is orphaned. Poor Erwin

                    am really an old <term ref="#t825" type="subject">woman</term>, but a healthy one, despite everything. If I only hadn’t had such a
