						<note>
							<p>Founded in 1927</p>
							<p>The Garda de Fier was a fascist and anti-Semitic movement in Romania, whose members were known as ‘Legionnaires’.
								Originally established in 1927 under the name ‘legion of the Archangel Michael’ and organized into paramilitary units,
								the Garda de Fier soon became a mass political movement. It was officially dissolved in 1933, but continued to
								function, even receiving the third largest number of votes in Romania’s 1937 election. During the mid-1930s the Garda
								de Fier also established ties with the Nazi regime in Germany. In 1938, Romania’s King Carol II again outlawed the
								Garda de Fier. Nonetheless, in 1940-09 he made a deal with the movement and invited its leaders into the government.
								The Garda de Fier immediately launched a wave of terror against Romania’s Jews in hopes of removing them from Romanian
								life. The passed racist laws and revitalized their ties with the Nazis and the fascist government in Italy. In 1941-01
								the Garda de Fier unsuccessfully attempted to take over the government completely. The failed coup was accompanied by
								pogroms, in which 123 Jews were killed. Most of the Garda de Fier leaders then fled to Germany. After the war, many of
								the Garda de Fier members escaped to Spain and Portugal, where they avoided trial as war criminals.</p>

			<p>Mr. <persName ref="#ehri_dr_scavenius_erik">Foreign minister</persName>,</p>
			<p>Through the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/719819/hungary.html">Hungarian</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-850" type="subject">National Radio Broadcasts</term>, it was announced
				that, in mid-January, the Prime Minister, General <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000010"
					>Antonescu</persName>, had been on a 1-day visit with Chancellor <persName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000185">Hitler</persName>. In <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/683506/bucharest.html">Bucharest</placeName> was the meeting not officially mentioned, and therefore
				gave rise to some remarkable rumours.</p>
			<p>A few days after the General’s return, a <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-005004">German General Staff
					Officer</orgName>, <persName ref="#ehri_dr_doering_helmut">Major Döring</persName>, was murdered on the street in Bucharest. The
				killer is said to be a man with a <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/390903/hellenic-republic.html">Greek</placeName> name,
					<persName ref="#ehri_dr_sarandos_dimitrie">Dimitrie Sarandos</persName>, who had come from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/6252001/united-states.html">America</placeName> with a <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/298795/republic-of-turkey.html">Turkish</placeName> passport and whose profession is stated as being
				a wrestler.</p>
			<p>The cause of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">murder</term> has so far not been
				resolved; officials say that they are still investigating the crime.</p>
			<p>However, this resulted in General <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000010">Antonescu’s</persName>
				dismissal of the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-454">legionary</orgName>
				<orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-006363">Minister of the Interior</orgName>, <persName
					ref="#ehri_dr_petrovicescu_constantin">General Petrovicescu</persName>, who was accused of not taking immediate action for a
				thorough investigation. The Legionary <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1068" type="subject">Press</term>
				protested against this dismissal, while at the same time emphasizing its strong association with the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1027" type="subject">Axis Powers</term>, calling for revenge on those who
				stood behind the killer.</p>
			<p>It can thus be concluded, that the murder was not aimed at the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1028"
					type="subject">presence of the Axis</term> in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/798549/romania.html">Romania</placeName>, as
				Romanian Patriots suggested it in a <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2635167/united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland.html">British</placeName> Radio
				broadcasts, since the warring parties agree that only the Axis military precautions in Romania save them from further segregation
				between their hostile neighbours.</p>
			<pb n="2" facs="EHRI-DR-19410127_02.jpg"/>
			<p>One could not fail to notice that the Press controlled by the Legionnaires made <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-989" type="subject">propaganda</term> for the Revolution, i.e. further
				looting of the possessive classes and especially of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864"
					type="subject">Jews</term> and new members of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1204"
					type="subject">Freemasons</term>.</p>
			<p>Finally, it was clear to the Prime Minister that he ruled with some Ministers in one direction, i.e. on the basis of the existence of
				evolutionary development, while the Deputy Prime Minister, <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-454"
					>Legionary</orgName> Commander <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000375">Horia Sima</persName>
				with other Ministers, ruled towards a Revolution and immediate looting and destruction of everything of endurance. The situation was
				unsustainable and as a first serious countermeasure from the Prime Minister’s site emerged on 21 of this month a decree abolishing the
				main efforts of the Legionnaires to <ref target="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/niod-trefwoorden-militarisering"
					>militarize</ref> the Romanian institutions as well as important State enterprises. I have reported this in my above-mentioned
				report.</p>
			<p>The answer to this relatively peaceful act was that the Legionary Party on the 22 of this month occupied a police barrack with 600 men,
				located right next to the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-003224">Foreign Ministry</orgName>, where
				the Prime Minister has his Bureau as well as his temporary residence. Thus, the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-254" type="subject">rebellion</term> had begun.</p>
			<p>It soon became clear that the Legionnaires were well supplied with <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1095"
					type="subject">rifles and ammunition</term>, and that they had prepared the action by <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-660" type="subject">pre-occupying</term> houses taken from <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-888" type="subject">wealthy Jews</term> in all districts. The garrison
				commanded by General <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000010">Antonescu</persName>, finally
				succeeded in capturing the Police barrack, from which the Legionnaires attacked the Foreign Ministry with the purpose of killing the
				General.</p>
			<p>On the first day, the military sought to avoid shooting and trusted the effect of their sole appearance. However, as <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1097" type="subject">Soldier</term> everywhere where shot down, during the
				course of the second day, a common battle erupted throughout the city, during which the military, with guns, tanks and machine guns,
				damaged the fortified houses of the Legionnaires.</p>
			<pb n="3" facs="EHRI-DR-19410127_03.jpg"/>
			<p>There were many dead and wounded on both sides, but we do not know how many. However, the number of victims is hardly proportional to
				the periodic violent cannonade that lasted all day and night for more than 2 days.</p>
			<p>All this time, Legionnaire gangs carried out gruesome <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-346" type="subject"
					>pogroms</term>, notably against the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-902" type="subject">Jewish
					Proletariat</term> in the suburbs, where large-scale <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536"
					type="subject">assassinations</term> and looting took place.</p>
			<p>In short, the vast majority of the so fiercely proclaimed <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-454"
					>Legionary Movement</orgName> people, i.e. The dregs of the City, took the opportunity to show who they really were, without the
				so-called leadership being able to limit the struggle to its true purpose, which was the creation of a pure Legionary government under
					<persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000375">Horia Sima</persName>.</p>
			<p>Following the culmination of the Romanian Military’s efforts early on <date when="1941-01-23">Thursday (the 23<hi rend="sup"
					>rd</hi></date>), <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000375">Horia Sima</persName> sent out, via
				Radio and leaflets, an <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1085" type="subject">order</term> to the
				Legionnaires to put down the weapons.</p>
			<p>The fighters only partially complied with the order, but in the course of the afternoon, at least, they succeeded in establishing peace
				while motorized divisions of the present <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">German Armed
					Forces</orgName> demonstratively drove through the city obviously prepared to assist the Romanian military if necessary.</p>
			<p>By Friday morning, the uprising was <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-255" type="subject">dissolved</term>
				and the entire city occupied by the Romanian Military, which began searching for the Legionnaires’ hidden abode and large quantities
				of stolen goods distributed over many houses have since been brought to light.</p>
			<p>Undoubtedly, the entire Rebellion has been planned and staged by General <persName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000010">Antonescu’s</persName> closest Employees in the Legionary
				State’s leadership.</p>
			<p>The <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004809">police</orgName> were searching for Deputy Prime Minister
					<persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000375">Horia Sima</persName> and it is said that he has been
				arrested today.</p>
			<p>The appointment of a general government was generally expected, but so far, nothing has been published regarding the transformation of
				the government, let alone its dismissal.</p>
			<p>In reality, it is fair to say that the country is currently administered solely the Governor, General <persName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000010">Antonescu</persName>, currently administers the country with the
				help of the declared state of emergency.</p>

			<p><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1117" type="subject">Intelligence</term> from the Province suggests that
				rebellions of the same kind as here have been common in the larger cities, while the rural population itself has turned against the
				plans of the Legionnaires.</p>
			<p>After the rebellion, General <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000010">Antonescu</persName> issued a
				comprehensive Proclamation to the People. The <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000010"
					>general</persName> thanked the Army for its courage, describing the suffering he went through before it became inevitable to
				shoot at the people, he declares that from now on he will personally take charge of the youth’s education and that all who are guilty
				will be <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-950" type="subject">punished</term>.</p>
			<p>General Disarmament will now be implemented by the Military.</p>
			<p>The Romanians here have stated to me that the proclamation is well suited to make an impression, especially within the large Romanian
				peasant population, but at the same time, it is found to be too lyrical and weak to deter future troublemakers.</p>
			<p>Especially regarding the last point, it is apparent that the <persName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000010">general</persName> now faces a number of challenges in setting
				up a new Ministry, but the situation is still too unclear to be overlooked.</p>
			<p>H.m. <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-001425">King Mihai</persName> and the Royal family have before
				and during the rebellion period stayed in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/667091/sinaia.html">Sinaia</placeName> without being
				directly involved in the events, as far as we know here in Bucharest.</p>
			<p>With the honourable mention, I have the honour to remain <persName ref="#ehri_dr_scavenius_erik">Mr. Foreign Minister’s</persName> most
				reverent,</p>
