			<p>Dear Chamberlain <persName ref="#ehri_dr_zahle_herluf">Zahle</persName></p>
			<p>The situation has worsened considerably, since 21 September of the same year, when I last reported about the conditions here. By the
				messages I have received I am under the impression that the <ref target="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/admindistricts-212"
					>State Protector</ref> and several of his officials sincerely wanted to establish a good relationship between <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germans</placeName> and <placeName
					ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_czechs">Czechs</placeName>. However, the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-407">party</orgName> with the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/maps/wikipedia_50.7361_15.74.html">Sudeten</placeName> German Secretary of State, Mr. <persName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000124">Frank</persName> at the helm have completely lacked the tact
				needed or they may have thought that with hardness one should suppress any <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-212" type="subject">resistance</term> from the <placeName
					ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_czechs">Czechs</placeName>.</p>
			<p>Now you can see a <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-671">Germanization</orgName> of the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-places-place-iti-64">Protectorate</placeName> in all areas.</p>
			<p>Many Czech estates, whose owners at the establishment of the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-places-place-iti-64">Protectorate</placeName> stayed abroad and did not
				return home, and estates which, at the demarcation, were located partly in the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-places-place-iti-64">Protectorate</placeName> and partly in the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/maps/wikipedia_52.5167_13.4.html">German Empire</placeName>, are placed under <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-600" type="subject">German administration</term>. It is expected, that
				similar extensions will take place in regard to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html"
					>German</placeName> Colonization. <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-889" type="subject">Jewish
					businesses</term> are mostly <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-930" type="subject">being handed
					over</term> to Germans. In <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-930" type="subject">Banks</term> and
				Industrial Enterprises, there is strong pressure from the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">German</placeName> side for mergers and transactions, so
				that the main influence of the company in question can be transferred to rich <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">German</placeName> banks.</p>
			<p>Perhaps some of these transactions - as a bank director familiar with Czech transactions in the post-World Bank banking sector, has
				told me - are merely restitutions, but in my opinion, the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">German</placeName> proceed with greater severity and
				consistency than the <placeName ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_czechs">Czechs</placeName> in this regard.</p>

			<p>Everywhere the German language is being preferred over the Czech language. <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1133" type="subject">Learning institutions</term> and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-695" type="subject">theatres</term> are taken over by the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/maps/wikipedia_52.5167_13.4.html">German Reich</placeName> and Germans are hired in all institutions
				and <ref target="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-jewishcouncil-organisation-jmp-392">administration offices</ref>. For
				example, an order has been imposed on the Tram conductors to call out the stations, first in German and then secondly in Czech, has
				caused unnecessary <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-813" type="subject">commotion</term> of the
				public.</p>
			<p>In <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-places-place-iti-64">Bohemia and Moravia</placeName>, there were no
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-833" type="subject">food</term> shortages and before the war broke
				out, there were large supplies and industrial goods of great quality. In a short period of time, the stocks have been emptied and a
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-834" type="subject">rationing system</term> has been introduced. The
				rationing is not yet as widespread as in the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/maps/wikipedia_52.5167_13.4.html">German
					Reich</placeName> but it is just a matter of time before this happens and then there will be a "<term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1175" type="subject">Gleichschaltung</term>". In addition, Dualism in the
				Administration contributes to the fact that the demand for rationed consumer goods is hardly as well organized as in the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/maps/wikipedia_52.5167_13.4.html">German Empire</placeName>. People often go to buy items, which
				according to the card system should be available just to find out that it is not.</p>
			<p>After the <term ref="#ehri_dr_Munich_Agreement" type="subject">Munich Decree</term> last year, the diminished territory of <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/8505031/czechoslovakia.html">Czechoslovakia</placeName> was established, and many <placeName
					ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_czechs">Czechs</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-813" type="subject">believed</term> that with a little goodwill they
				could establish great relations with the German Empire. After the creation of the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-places-place-iti-64">Protectorate</placeName>, a few people still hoped this
				was possible but now you won’t find a single Czech person that doesn’t feel resentment against Germany. I don’t think that these
				feelings will cause any outbreaks as long as the German discipline stands firm. The people are not armed and they know that the
					<orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">German troops</orgName> and the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject">German police</term> will <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-601" type="subject">suppress</term> any demonstration with extreme

			<p>In the first period of the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-places-place-iti-64"

					>released</term> and they believed that the main clash with Germans and people not well regarded by them had taken place. When the
				war broke out, <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo's</orgName> activity increased and in
				addition to the before-mentioned, a large number of members of the Military were now also arrested, as well as people from the
				industries, clerics and many others. Ever since it looks like the arrests won’t stop and it is difficult to see a system in the
				actions of <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName>, you might see this as taking <term

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1007" type="subject">diplomat</term>, which has been retired for several
				years, told me about some of the arrests. He told about how certain people on the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo's</orgName> list of arrests had remained in Freedom – at
				least until now – just because they were not at home when the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350"
					>Gestapo</orgName> came for them, so the police went on to the next one on the list. My informant told me that he changed his
				residence because he was afraid that he was going to be arrested. Many of the arrested people will be sent to the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-43" type="camp">concentration camp Buchenwald</placeName> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/maps/wikipedia_52.5167_13.4.html">Germany</placeName>. A reliable source told me that the internees

			<p>The prominent <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term>, the ones who lived there

				have their Aryan colleagues take the cases to court. Some <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1427"

			<p>Under the conditions described above, the former Czechoslovakia National Day, on October 28, was met with great anxiety. When it was
				reported that the <placeName ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_czechs">Czechs</placeName> wanted to grieve that day, the Germans had planned
				a mourning ceremony for the fallen people in Poland. The <placeName ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_czechs">Czechs</placeName> then
				canceled their plans, and the Czech national unity party ordered its members to stay indoors and keep calm. The Germans also distanced
				themselves from holding the mourning ceremony. Despite the fact that it was <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-752" type="subject">Labour Day</term>, the traffic in the main streets was
				very busy. In spite of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-952" type="subject">prohibition</term>, many
				Czech people wore cockades with silk ribbons in the Czechoslovakia colours, and many male persons covered their heads with the same
				kind of cap of as the late President <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000266">Masaryk</persName>
				usually wore. All the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004772">Czech Police</orgName> was stationed in
				the Main Streets and the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004312">German Police</orgName> and <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">S.S.</orgName>-members had taken up positions as a reserve in side
				streets and passages. The tensions erupted into fights as large sections the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-358">S.A.</orgName>-members passed through the main streets with music,
				and various clashes between the Czech people's groups and the police took place. In some streets, the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1000" type="subject">Communists</term> demonstrated, and German police had
				to support the Czech police to get the streets cleared. During the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-255"
					type="subject">clashes</term>, a couple of persons (allegedly a dozen people) were killed and some of them were injured. A couple
				of young people were arrested.</p>
			<p/>
			<p>However, in view of the population’s agitated state of mind, the events must be considered less serious than one might have expected.
				This was also stated to me by a German Official from the <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000185"
					>Chancellor's</persName> Office. However, we cannot exclude that the incidents will give rise to new <pb n="6"
