			<p>Re: <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-351">The Jewish problem</term> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3202326/republic-of-croatia.html">Croatia</placeName></p>
			<p>A year after the start of the anti-Jewish campaign undertaken by the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-359"
					type="subject">Ustashe Regime</term> when they came to power, and now that the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3202326/republic-of-croatia.html">Croatian</placeName> racial policy has been normalized within a
				framework of strict legality, assessing the situation may be of some interest.</p>
			<p>Croatian <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-328" type="subject">racism</term> is based on and finds its
				justification in paragraph XI of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-359" type="subject">Ustashe</term>
				Principles of 1933 that for the first time mentions <q>Croatian blood</q>.</p>
			<p>From this source derives the law-decree of <date when="1941-04-30">30th April 1941</date> on the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-373" type="subject">Aryan race</term>, the fundamental text of <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3202326/republic-of-croatia.html">Croatian</placeName> racism.</p>
			<p>According to that <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-950" type="subject">law</term>, all persons are
				considered <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jewish</term>:</p>
			<p>l) if they have at least three ancestors in the second degree who belong to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jewish race</term>;</p>
			<p>2) if they have two ancestors of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jewish
					race</term>, namely in the following instances:</p>
			<p>a) if on the date of the <date when="1941-04-10">10th April 1941</date> they belonged to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jewish</term> religion or if they later converted to
				that <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-724" type="subject">religion</term>,</p>
			<p>b) if they have a spouse who is considered <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject"
					>Jewish</term>,</p>
			<p>c) if after the present decree has come into force they have entered into <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-741" type="subject">matrimony</term> with a person having two or more
				ancestors in the second degree belonging to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject"
					>Jewish race</term>, also the children issued from such a marriage,</p>
			<p>d) if they are the illegitimate children of a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject"
					>Jew</term>,</p>
			<pb n="2" facs="EHRI-DR-19420512-IT_02.jpg"/>
			<p>3) if they were born outside the territory of the Independent State of <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3202326/republic-of-croatia.html">Croatia</placeName> from parents who do not trace their origins to
				the Independent State of <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3202326/republic-of-croatia.html">Croatia</placeName>, if at the date
				of <date when="1941-04-10">10th April 1941</date> they belonged to the Jewish religion or if they have at least two ancestors in the
				second degree belonging to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jewish race</term>,
				or if they are considered Jews by the law of the country from where they originate.</p>
			<p>4) if after the present decree came into force they enter into <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-741"
					type="subject">matrimony</term> with a non-Aryan person.</p>
			<p>5) if they are the illegitimate children of a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jewish
					woman</term>.</p>
			<p>Persons belonging to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jewish race</term> do not
				enjoy citizenship rights and are therefore banned from taking part in economic, social, youth, sports and cultural activities and
				organizations of the <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_croatians" type="subject">Croatian People</term> in general, and more
				particularly in literature, journalism, sculpture, music, theatre and cinema.</p>
			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-terms-keyword-jmp-542" type="subject">law-decree</term> of <date
					when="1941-04-30">30th April 1941</date> must be considered together with the other <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-terms-keyword-jmp-542" type="subject">decree</term> instituting the
					<q>Political Commission on Race</q>, which delivers opinions and offers suggestions on all cases in which the racial status is in
				doubt, and with the other, <q>On the Protection of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-373" type="subject"
						>Aryan</term> Blood and the Honour of the <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_croatians" type="subject">Croatian
					People</term></q>, which absolutely forbids marriage between <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864"
					type="subject">Jews</term> or persons not belonging to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-373"
					type="subject">Aryan</term> race and persons of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-373"
					type="subject">Aryan race</term> and punishes with great severity extramarital relations between the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> or a person not of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-373" type="subject">Aryan</term> blood and female persons of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-373" type="subject">Aryan origin</term>.</p>
			<p>In addition to these legislative measures there is also a body of police regulations concerning <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term>, the main being:</p>
			<p><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> are banned from living in certain parts
				of town</p>
			<p>their personal property is confiscated without compensation</p>
			<p>they are forbidden to keep radios and telephones</p>
			<p>male Jews aged from 16 to 60 must have themselves entered in special registers</p>
			<p>they must all, irrespective of age and gender, wear a special badge on the chest and on the back</p>
			<p>they must observe a special curfew</p>
			<p>they are forbidden to loiter in the streets in the city centre, and may only pass through</p>
			<p>they are banned from entering public establishments, etc.</p>
			<pb n="3" facs="EHRI-DR-19420512-IT_03.jpg"/>
			<p>Having thus determined the legal status of persons belonging to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864"
					type="subject">Jewish race</term>, it became necessary to settle all attendant economic matters.</p>
			<p>A first step was therefore to declare null and void all contracts entered into between Jews and between Jews and others in the 60 days
				preceding the declaration of the Independent State of <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3202326/republic-of-croatia.html"
					>Croatia</placeName>, if the value of the contract was over 100,000 Dinars and if it had not been subsequently approved by the
				Ministry of Justice.</p>
			<p>Almost at the same time a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-terms-keyword-jmp-542" type="subject"
					>law-decree</term> was issued whereby all businesses that were entirely or partially owned by <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> as well as those in which one or more Jews
				were sitting on the Board of Directors or had managerial posts were considered <q>Jewish</q>.</p>
			<p>That same decree ordered Jews, persons of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-373" type="subject">Aryan
					origin</term> joined in matrimony with Jews, foreign Jews who were on Croatian territory as of <date when="1941-06-05">5th June
					1941</date> and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-889" type="subject">Jewish businesses</term> to
				report their assets as well as all changes of ownership that had occurred after <date when="1941-02-10">10th February 1941</date>.</p>
			<p>With this decree any alienation of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-887" type="subject">Jewish
					property</term>, as well as the transfer of Jewish businesses, of stocks, of shares in consortia and other property rights was
				made impossible, since any contract of whatever kind required the approval of the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004345">Ministry of National Economy</orgName>.</p>
			<p>Jewish businesses thus confiscated by the State might be managed by the State itself, or be either leased, sold or liquidated in favour
				of the Treasury. The final decision in all these cases lies with the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004345">Ministry of National Economy</orgName>.</p>
			<p>Lastly, with the Decree of <date when="1941-10-10">10th October 1941</date>, the authority on all matters concerning the estates of
				individual <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> or of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-889" type="subject">Jewish businesses</term> has been assigned to the
					<q>State Department for Reconstruction</q> which may, with a discretionary decision that admits no recourse, nationalize the
				assets of any <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> as well as of any Jewish
				business and determine what compensation, if any, shall be paid and how.</p>
			<p>The estates thus acquired can be assigned to the Independent State of Croatia or to the State Department for Reconstruction.</p>
			<pb n="4" facs="EHRI-DR-19420512-IT_04.jpg"/>
			<p>Recently this Department, as well as the Political Commission on Race, have been eliminated and all authority in matters concerning
				Jewish economic questions and the assessment of race has been transferred to the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-001789">Ministry of Finance</orgName>, Office for Nationalized Assets, and
				the Ministry of Interior Affairs respectively.</p>
			<p>The implementation of all these measures has not, in truth, been very easy.</p>
			<p>Croatian public opinion, being insufficiently prepared for a racial campaign and still wary of the new Regime, but most of all shaken
				by a string of illegal acts carried out by unscrupulous <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-359"
					type="subject">Ustashe officials</term>, had a rather negative reaction against these anti-Jewish measures and watched the course
				of events with great scepticism.</p>
			<p>From a technical point of view, moreover, the State Department for Reconstruction, which ought to have been the buttress of the entire
				system, and whose task it was basically to centralize and draw up an inventory of all <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-887" type="subject">Jewish property</term>, proved decidedly inferior to
				the task they had been entrusted with, both because their offices were disorganized and because its officials had absolutely no
				experience in such matters.</p>
			<p>This state of affairs was taken advantage of by elements of the German ethnic group in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3202326/republic-of-croatia.html">Croatia</placeName> who, through their financial organizations,
				were able to acquire legally the main formerly Jewish businesses.</p>
			<p>Lastly, as to the present situation of <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_croatians" type="subject">Croats</term> who own formerly <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-887" type="subject">Jewish property</term>, it must be pointed out that
				they have acquired it in many different ways but mainly through a system of fictitious sales carried out for the benefit of persons
				appointed by the State to the task of managing said property.</p>
			<p>Of the 40,000 Jews who, it has been estimated, were living in Croatian territory, only approx. 6,000 are left, almost all interned in
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">concentration camps</term> or assigned to farm
				work or to land reclamation. Of the rest, some have managed to emigrate and some must be considered <q>missing</q>.</p>
			<p>The Jewish problem can therefore be considered virtually solved in the Independent State of <term
					ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_croatians" type="subject">Croatia</term>; a few issues still remain pending, such for instance as
				mixed marriages, <pb n="5" facs="EHRI-DR-19420512-IT_05.jpg"/> but they too will soon be dealt with and settled.</p>
