						<note><p>Founded in 1925</p><p>The Schutzstaffel was a small detachment was formed in 1925 to provide security for Hitler.
								Beginning in 1929, under the tutelage of Heinrich Himmler, the SS was enlarged and became an independent entity
								(1944-07) within the Nazi Party. In 1934, it effectively eliminated its rival, the SA, during the Night of the Long
								Knives. The SS was composed of the Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei, Waffen-SS,and Totenkopfverbaende. All police agencies
								were brought under the control of the SS in 1936. The Nuremberg Tribunal declared the SS to be a criminal organization
								for the ‘persecution and extermination of Jews’, brutality and murder of inmates in concentration camps, excesses in
								their administration of occupied territories, exploitation of slave labor, and mistreatment of POWs.</p></note>

								placed under the Sturmabteilung (Storm Division). Between 1933 and 1945 that vast majority of German’s children were
								members of the HJ, the junior branch of the Nazi Party. Boys were taught the beliefs of National Socialism and trained
								for military service. Determining that by age ten children’s minds could be turned from play to politics, the regime
								inducted nearly all German juveniles between ages of ten and eighteen into its state-run organization. The result was
								a potent tool for the will of Adolf Hitler. When Nazi Germany finally surrendered on 1945-05-07, the HJ came to an
								end.</p></note>

						<note><p>1863/present</p><p>The International Committee of the Red Cross was founded in 1863 as a humanitarian organization to
								moderate between belligerents and to monitor application of humanitarian international law. This body was charged to
								oversee humane conditions in POW camps among civilian internees during wartime, but gained limited access to
								concentration camps. With the exception of two visits to Dutch inmates interned at Buchenwald in 1940, and the
								inspection of Theresienstadt at the behest of the Danish government (where they were fooled in by the SS in 1944), the
								Red Cross was never able to enter concentration camps until late in the war. The ICRC did not take great initiatives
								to intervene on behalf of the Jews for fear losing its credibility with the Axis Powers, thus losing its position to
								work on behalf of POWs and civilian internees. In 1995, ICRC president, Cornelio Sommaruga, finally admitted his
								agency’s inaction during the Holocaust.</p></note>

					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czechs</placeName> told me, but to keep me out of the way, so to speak. First,

				– exactly the same procedure as with the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName>.
				Except for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1091" type="subject">uniform</term> and the language,
				nothing had changed. Then I was led to the second floor of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669"
					type="subject">prison</term> to be admitted to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"

					>cell</term> was already <q>occupied</q> by nine <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject"

				single <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoner</term>. We had to lie on the floor

				had some <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">bread</term> with me, which they at once

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">crowns</term>. All this was <term

					type="subject">cell</term>, however, but to the door of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837"

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term> is. Thus IIIB was on the third floor.</p>
			<p>Although I had not left the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prison</term>, I had to
				strip to be searched again. Only then was I allowed to enter the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837"

			<p>In <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term> 197 there were <q>only</q> seven <term

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-320" type="subject">mental</term> suffering.</p>
			<p>We were so dreadfully <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569" type="subject">hungry</term> that we tore
				grass from the meagre lawn during our turns in the courtyard in order to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eat</term> it. Anyone caught red-handed was flogged.
				That is why there was a big <q>but</q>: how could we get this grass without being noticed by the overseer? That was not easy because
				the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guards</term> watched us very closely. One of
				our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">mates</term> would stop and bend down in order to
				re-tie <q>loose</q>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">shoe</term> laces. Thus he drew the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard’s</term> attention to himself and one of the
				others could pull up some grass which was shared out <pb n="5" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560421_05.jpg"/> and <term

			<p>We noticed that one of the head <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">warders</term> lived
				on <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eggs</term> – allegedly for <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-791" type="subject">health</term> reasons. Convinced, though wrongly, that
				by eating <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">egg</term> shells we would provide our
				bodies with calcium, we asked him to give us the shells, which he did very readily. We then ground the shells to powder and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">ate</term> them, until a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">doctor</term> was transferred to our <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term>. He told us that the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">egg</term> shell had no <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1431" type="subject">nutritional</term> value at all, and left the body
				unchanged.</p>
			<p>We had lost an illusion!</p>
			<p>To fill our stomachs more effectively we soaked the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
					>bread</term> in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">water</term> until it was like
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">mush</term>. Thus the volume of our <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> was greater and we felt full, even though
				it was not more <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1431" type="subject">nutritious</term>. We only had one
				thought: what can we do about the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569" type="subject">hunger</term>?
				Some smoked the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">potato</term> peelings to try to
				think of something else.</p>
			<p>Although the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName> and <orgName

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> were my enemies, I could not bear to

				horrible because I was forced to watch.</p>
			<p>Usually these atrocities took place on Sundays, because there was less supervision. On the floor below us there were <orgName

			<p>When the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1057" type="subject">workers</term> returned from <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> in the evening they were thrilled, because

					>population</term>. It turned out that the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject"
					>people</term> had not known that these were <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html"
					>Germans</placeName>. From all sides they had been slipped <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286"
					type="subject">bread</term> and an occasional piece of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
					type="subject">sausage</term>. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">bread</term>
				which they were unable to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eat</term> they brought
				back to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term>. Unfortunately, I gave into
				temptation to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eat</term> my fill, which did not
				agree with me – it turned my stomach.</p>
			<p>The following evening the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1057" type="subject">workers</term> had to line
				up outside the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term> door. All the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">bread</term> they had was taken away.</p>
			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> they had to do was to clear the
				narrow courtyards of the rubbish that had accumulated over the years. As I saw later, the rubbish was metres high in the narrow
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3067695/hlavni-mesto-praha.html">Prague</placeName> courtyards, giving rise to air
				pollution.</p>
			<p>Since my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">mates</term> painted a glowing picture of their
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> I was also tempted to apply for
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>, to make life more tolerable. My
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> wanted to help me, and put me into
				a group which <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">worked</term> for the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2017370/russian-federation.html">Russians</placeName>. He thought we would be well <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">fed</term> there; but although we had to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> very hard, we did not get anything at all
				to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eat</term>. The next day the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2017370/russian-federation.html">Russian</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1097" type="subject">soldier</term> wanted to fetch us again, but nobody
				wanted to go. The <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2017370/russian-federation.html">Russian</placeName> promised us a hot <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">meal</term> and plenty of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">bread</term> … and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1043" type="subject">compensation</term> for the previous day. We had to
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> even harder, we were harried like
				slaves. We were given not <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> but
				whippings.</p>
			<p>Some days later I went into the town with a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject"
					>work</term> detail. We were employed to sweep the streets and also to clear the heaps of rubble. These were so firmly compacted
				that we had to use hoes to loosen them. To make up for this we received 250g of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">bread</term> and 50g of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">sausage</term>. After <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-570" type="subject">starving</term> for so long this was a real relief.
				But we only got this <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-834" type="subject">ration</term> once, it became
				smaller every day – whether this was above board or through racketeering I don’t know. My body, however, was telling me that I was
				using up more calories than I was consuming, so that I had to give up <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">working</term>: after all, I did not want to go
				completely to the dogs. What made the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>
				worse was that the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guards</term> were <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">workmen</term> themselves who beat us with their rifle
				butts. Even though they were road sweepers themselves they did not have a clue how to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> efficiently. They forced us eight at a
				time to load a lorry from one side. Consequently we stood in each other’s way, and could not help throwing the dirt at each other. If
				they had employed four <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> at a time, letting

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> in turns, we could easily have done much
				more. But this would have required brains, which they did not have.</p>
			<p>After a longer interval some <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1057" type="subject">workers</term> were
				withdrawn from a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> detail, the best one in
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3067695/hlavni-mesto-praha.html">Prague</placeName>, and were put into a <term

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">worked</term> in this group took me with him and now a

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-753" type="subject">Christmas</term>. There was plenty of very good <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>, there was so much that I was able to

			<p>In <date when="1944-07">July</date> and also in <date when="1944-08">August</date> somebody had delivered a parcel with linen and <term

			<p>On <date when="1945-12-10">10 December 1945</date> I met my misfortune in the person of the head <term

			<p>On another occasion a new <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoner</term> was thrown
				into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term>, who was <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">bleeding</term> like a stuck pig. His name was
					<persName ref="#ehri_et_walter">Walter</persName>, he had become a <placeName

					>Translator’s note: this was of course during the <placeName

						ref="http://www.geonames.org/8505031/czechoslovakia.html">Czechoslovakian Republic</placeName></note>. I often thought I was
				in a madhouse. I could continue talking for a long time about these incidents; but I think that will do to give the reader an idea of
				what human irrationality can lead to. Instead of turning away from the atrocities committed by the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germans</placeName>, these were used as pretexts and
				excuses to commit new crimes, even <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">murders</term>,
				in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prisons</term>.</p>
			<p>I am convinced that none of these atrocities could have happened if there had been strict supervision. The director was nowhere to be
				seen, the head <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">warders</term> were either too lazy
				or too cowardly or they even took part in these crimes. They let the younger <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guards</term> do as they wished.</p>
			<p>From <date when="1946-01-04">4 January 1946</date> until <date when="1946-02-06">6 February</date> I was again with my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> detail. I was glad that I did not hear or
				see anything of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prison</term>, and that I was
				receiving good <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> again. Unfortunately
				these good times were to end on <date when="1946-02-06">6 February</date>. On that day a five-ton lorry came especially to take me
				from my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> back to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prison</term>. In the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject">police</term> guardroom in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prison</term> I was informed that my sons were fine …
				and then I was forbidden to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>. Perhaps the
				official was afraid I might <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">escape</term>. If I had
				wanted to do that I could have <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">fled</term> any day,
				as many others did. I was not interested in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject"
					>escaping</term> because that would have proved that I had a guilty conscience. But if I had known what lay ahead of me, that I
				would have to spend another whole year in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czech</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prisons</term> and that I would almost <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">die</term>, I would have <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">fled</term> then.</p>
			<p>On <date when="1946-02-15">15 February</date> I was suddenly fetched and handed over to a superintendent of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject">police</term> headquarters. He took me to his office,
				and this was my first and only <q><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1135" type="subject"
						>examination</term></q>. When it was over the official explained to me, <q>On Monday or Tuesday we are having a conference. I
					am going to present your personal case and you will be <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-651"
						type="subject">released</term> in a few days. You can count on compensation for wrongful <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-652" type="subject">imprisonment</term>.</q> Then he led me to the <pb
					n="9" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560421_09.jpg"/> officers’ mess, ordered a considerable amount of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> for me, and left after shaking my hand.
				Then I really believed that I would be <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-651" type="subject"
					>released</term> in a few days. But I was to stay another eleven long, hard months, virtually put into cold storage. I had
				expected the affairs of a former <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">KZ</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoner</term> to be given priority treatment, but
				I was mistaken; there was no conference at all. The <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czechs</placeName>
				had overdone it by <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598" type="subject">arresting</term> hundreds of
				thousands indiscriminately. They were simply not able to cope with these <q>cases</q>.</p>
			<p>In the meantime I had been put back into section BIII and so I was <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569"
					type="subject">starving</term> again. So I tried to obtain the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html"
					>Czech</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-834" type="subject">rations</term> I was entitled to. I asked to see the
				director, but the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> took me to the head
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">warder</term> instead. This <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term> listened to me … nothing happened! Section
				IIIB was run particularly badly, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term>
				was the mere tool of the trusty, he did not care about anything. We even had to collect drinking <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">water</term> from the toilet; I can well imagine that
				this was why we all suffered from <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">diarrhoea</term>.
				In <date when="1946-04">April 1946</date> I saw the director for the first time on his rounds. I presented my request to him, he
				promised to examine my case, but nothing happened!</p>
			<p>When at last I had had enough I tried in vain to file a petition. This was not allowed but had the effect nevertheless that my
				situation was considered, and that I was transferred to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html"
					>Leitmeritz</placeName> because the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject"
					>people</term> in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3067695/hlavni-mesto-praha.html">Prague</placeName> did not dare to
				decide anything.</p>
			<p>Well, I continued to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569" type="subject">starve</term> until the wife of
				a fellow <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoner</term> felt sorry for me and sent
				me a parcel. This was not allowed either, but for a week I had something to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eat</term>.</p>
			<p>On <date when="1946-06-26">26 June 1946</date> I was <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-575" type="subject"
					>transferred</term> to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName>. <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName> was better organised than <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3067695/hlavni-mesto-praha.html">Prague</placeName>. Immediately and urgently I demanded <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czech</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>, which the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> simply denied me, since I had not spoken
				to him in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czech</placeName>. When I demanded to be taken to the
				director, he refused this too. The following week, however, I requested permission to write <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject">letters</term>. When I asked the director to allow me
				to write to the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/8502102/new-england-region.html">English</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1118" type="subject">ambassador</term>, to the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-419">Red Cross</orgName> and to my son, he at once granted permission.
				Getting bolder, I asked for <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czech</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>, which I received the same day. Now at
				last I had contact with the outside world, although it took a long time until I received an answer.</p>
			<p>On the day after my committal to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName> I was
				presented to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prison</term>
				<pb n="10" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560421_10.jpg"/>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">doctor</term> who realised how weakened I was, and
				promised at once that I would be put into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject"
					>prison</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term> as soon as there was a bed
				available. But before my admission I had a serious bout of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292"
					type="subject">enteritis</term>.</p>
			<p>At last, on <date when="1946-08-09">9 August</date>, I was admitted and stayed in this ward until my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-651" type="subject">release</term> on <date when="1947-01-09">9 January
					1947</date>.</p>
			<p>In <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName> for the first time I came across <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guards</term> who had stayed humane. <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_prohaska">Prohaska</persName> and <persName ref="#ehri_et_faltin">Faltin</persName>, two young <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guards</term> who had suffered themselves under the
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germans</placeName> and therefore knew how a
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoner</term> felt. But there were also
				others: the worst ones were probably <persName ref="#ehri_et_adamczyk">Adamczyk</persName> and <persName ref="#ehri_et_pfeifer"
					>Pfeifer</persName>. The latter <q>treated</q> an <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2782113/republic-of-austria.html"
					>Austrian</placeName> called <persName ref="#ehri_et_seifert">Seifert</persName> on his arrival by forcing him to lie in a bath
				filled with cold water. He was made to put his feet out, and <persName ref="#ehri_et_pfeifer">Pfeifer</persName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject">tortured</term> them so badly that <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_seifert">Seifert</persName> passed out. <persName ref="#ehri_et_seifert">Seifert</persName> never recovered from
				this <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject">maltreatment</term>, and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">died</term> in the autumn of <date when="1946"

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>, he did not get it, nor was he taken to

			<p><persName ref="#ehri_et_adamczyk">Adamczyk</persName> shattered a boy’s <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">eardrum</term>.</p>
			<p>In <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3067695/hlavni-mesto-praha.html">Prague</placeName> as well as in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName> not knowing the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czech</placeName> language was the worst that could happen to you. The <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">SS</orgName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> were able to gain many an advantage
				thanks to their knowledge of the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czech</placeName> language.</p>
			<p>Even worse then the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guards</term> were the
					<q>trusties</q>, though they were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject"
					>prisoners</term> themselves. They were chosen by the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480"
					type="subject">guards</term>. The trusties distributed the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
					type="subject">food</term> and whoever could pay with a cigarette got more <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> and more <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">bread</term>, naturally at the expense of those who
				did not have anything to offer. That the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject"
					>guards</term> were bad psychologists is surely proved by the fact that one of the trusties was hanged and another one was
				sentenced to ten years’ hard <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">labour</term>. It often
				happened that the trusties beat their fellow <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject"
					>prisoners</term> in order to gain the respect of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480"
					type="subject">guards</term>.</p>
			<p>In <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3067695/hlavni-mesto-praha.html">Prague</placeName>-<placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3068601/pankrac.html">Pancrace</placeName> I was in four different sections. Only one, section A11,
				was properly organised, although this was the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html"
					>German</placeName> section. Every day we received a jug of drinking <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">water</term>, a bucket of water for washing, and more
				drinking <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">water</term> several times on hot days.
				Each <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term> had a jug and a bucket, something
				no other section had to offer. There were also enough blankets and palliasses <pb n="11" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560421_11.jpg"/> [straw
				mattresses] in section AII and they were well kept. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480"
					type="subject">guard</term>
				<persName ref="#ehri_et_prohaska">Prohaska</persName> saw to it that the palliasses were refilled from time to time and that the dust
				was beaten out of the blankets. In section A1 the palliasses were in a bad state and there were not enough of them: seven <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> had to share three.</p>
			<p>Section BIII was the worst of all. There had been only two palliasses for seven <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> until we gave some cigarettes [in exchange]
				for two extra palliasses, and even for blankets! Although when we had asked before for blankets and palliasses the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> had told us he had not got any.
				Cigarettes were the keys to every door! From about <date when="1946-04">April 1946</date> smoking was officially permitted in
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3068601/pankrac.html">Pancrace</placeName> but only for the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czechs</placeName>. But this ban for <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germans</placeName> was not observed too strictly since it
				meant a good income. The daily ration was two cigarettes but the cigarettes which arrived in the parcels – and there were fifty in
				each parcel – usually were not sufficient until the next delivery because there were too many <q>fellow smokers</q>. Many <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1057" type="subject">workers</term> brought cigarettes from outside into
				their <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cells</term>. That was forbidden, and there
				were daily body searches, but they still succeeded. Often the cigarettes were <q><term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-584" type="subject">confiscated</term></q> but just as often the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1057" type="subject">workers</term> succeeded in tricking the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guards</term>. It was a daily struggle between <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoner</term>. First the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> won, then the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoner</term>. Often good-natured <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guards</term> let the cigarettes through. Once even a
				razor was <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-266" type="subject">smuggled</term> into the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term>, although the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoner</term> had been stripped.</p>
			<p>Once a <q><placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">German</placeName></q> played a nasty trick
				on me. He put a pencil into my pocket without me noticing. The pencil was found, of course, at a control. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> must have seen from my surprised
				expression that I was dumbfounded. He did not do anything about it, otherwise this would have meant being put into a darkened <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term> for me.</p>
			<p>In section AII there were strict rules about <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-295" type="subject"
					>hygiene</term> – we had to shave and have a bath once a week; but this was not the case in the other sections. Those who <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">worked</term> outside usually had a chance to get
				shaved, which they used liberally. Such <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-119" type="subject"
					>criminals</term> we were!</p>
			<p>Smoking was of course strictly forbidden in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
					>cells</term>, but there was not a single <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
					>cell</term> where we did not smoke. In <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName>
				smoking was generally forbidden, but nevertheless <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject"
					>people</term> smoked. I don’t want to described how we managed, not having any matches. Necessity is the mother of invention.</p>
			<p>In <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3068601/pankrac.html">Pancrace</placeName> we were allowed to play games like chess,
				dominoes, and nine men’s morris <note place="bottom">A board game for two players, also known as <q>merels</q></note>. <pb n="12"
					facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560421_12.jpg"/> In <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName> this
				was forbidden, but we still played. Many a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject"
					>guard</term> turned a blind eye to this, others used it as a welcome opportunity to hit us. There was one <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> who searched the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term> every day; what he permitted one day he
				forbade the next. I had two bottles of different <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-285" type="subject"

				<persName ref="#ehri_et_prohaska">Prohaska</persName> was remarkable for his correct behaviour. His demeanour was always measured, he
				never shouted, he was always a decent chap, a praiseworthy exception! Never lazy, nothing was too much [trouble] for him and I was
				surprised to see the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoners’</term> reactions.
				When <persName ref="#ehri_et_prohaska">Prohaska</persName> was on duty the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1057" type="subject">workers</term> never brought cigarettes back with

				since there was always the possibility of a snap check.</p>
			<p>In <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName> it was really unpleasant that we did not
				have wc’s in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cells</term>. It was particularly
				unpleasant on Saturdays and Sundays. On these days the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837"
					type="subject">cells</term> were locked by noon, and they were not opened again until the following day. So we had to make do with
				one toilet bucket which was just big enough for one <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject"
					>man</term>. That was impossible, as we all suffered from <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292"
					type="subject">diarrhoea</term>. Once a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject"
					>man</term> came into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term> at 6 pm. I
				asked him to let us <q>slop out</q> [empty the bucket] because the bucket was overflowing. He refused, and we were forced to use our
				washbasin too. Even today I wonder why there was no <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-492" type="subject"
					>epidemic</term>. When <persName ref="#ehri_et_prohaska">Prohaska</persName> was on duty he came without being asked, and let us
				empty the bucket.</p>
			<p>In <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName> there was no drinking <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">water</term> in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cells</term>, so we had to take <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">water</term> from the bucket which was used for
				cleaning the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term>. Perhaps that was one of
				the reasons why all of us suffered from <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject"
					>diarrhoea</term>. Washing <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term> was
				also a problem under these circumstances. Some <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject"
					>guards</term> allowed us to rinse our washing in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836"
					type="subject">laundry</term> but most did not. We were dependent on moods! I leave it to the reader to imagine what sometimes
				resulted from these conditions.</p>
			<p>In <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName> exercise in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prison</term> yard was also on the agenda, but often,
				far too often, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cells</term> were searched
				instead, and often daily for a whole week, so that we had to do without the necessary fresh air. <pb n="13"
					facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560421_13.jpg"/> Very often the exercise was anything but recreation: we were hounded as if we had to set a
				record. Then we returned to our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term>,
				completely exhausted. We threw ourselves down onto the floor because sitting on the palliasses was forbidden. Often after such an
				event the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cells</term> were searched as well. Every
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> was a law unto himself. One allowed
				paper cartons to put the washing in, another threw them out. A few allowed us to sit on the palliasses since there was only one stool
				and there was not enough room for so many <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject"
					>prisoners</term> to sit down.</p>
			<p>There were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guards</term> who were really inventive as
				far as <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject">torturing</term> us during our exercise
				periods was concerned. When I said once to a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject"
					>guard</term> that the treatment here was worse than in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496"
					type="subject">KZ</term>, he answered that it was in a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496"
					type="subject">KZ</term> that he had learnt it. From then, whenever he was on duty I had to keep out of the way.</p>
			<p>As already mentioned I could have sent <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject">letters</term>
				if I had had stamps or <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">money</term>. But how could I
				get <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">money</term> or stamps? That was sheer sadism.
				They had taken away my 450 <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czech</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">crowns</term>. Now I wrote some <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject">letters</term> and mentioned this <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">money</term>. Some months later the trusty showed me
				the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject">letters</term> – they had not been posted. The
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> had not even tried.</p>
			<p>I tried to find another way to order a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>
				parcel – we could not think of anything else. So I wanted to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-266"
					type="subject">smuggle</term> a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject">letter</term>
				out of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prison</term>. I gave this <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject">letter</term> secretly to a <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czech</placeName> fellow <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoner</term>. A <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">German</placeName> fellow <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoner</term> who had been the Managing Director of
				the <orgName ref="#ehri_et_raiffeisenbank">Raiffeisenbank</orgName> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3067695/hlavni-mesto-praha.html">Prague</placeName> gave me away. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> did slap me but he was fair and did not
				report me. I told him that I had been forced to write in order to get something to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eat</term>, since he had not posted my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject">letters</term>. Perhaps that was why he refrained from
				reporting me, and also because the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject">letter</term> was
				addressed to the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-419">Red Cross</orgName>.</p>
			<p>In <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName> it was not necessary to write <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject">letters</term> secretly because the director was
				generous in allowing us to send <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject">letters</term>; he
				even paid for my stamps. It was such a relief to meet this <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826"
					type="subject">man</term> – he treated all the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject"
					>prisoners</term> as human beings. Unfortunately, every <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650"
					type="subject">prisoner</term> had to tell the head <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480"
					type="subject">warder</term> in advance what he wanted to speak to the director about, so complaints were hardly possible. I am
				sure the director would have stopped that at once. I know about one case when the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoner</term> invented something in order to be
				taken to the director. When at last he was received by the director he complained about being repeatedly maltreated. On the <pb n="14"
					facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560421_14.jpg"/> way back to his <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837"
					type="subject">cell</term> the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> led
				him to his office and mistreated the poor chap so much that he had to be carried back to his <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">cell</term>. If the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoners</term> had had the chance to do what they
				were allowed to do according to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prison</term>
				rules or by the director there would have been fewer <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-653" type="subject"
					>punishments</term>.</p>
			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> was the power, the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoner</term> had no rights.</p>
			<p>I will always have fond memories of the director in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html"
					>Leitmeritz</placeName>. It was to him that I owed contact with my sons.</p>
			<p>On <date when="1946-06-22">22 June 1946</date> I wrote to the examining magistrate in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName> in order to learn what I was accused of, so that I
				might be able to comment on it. I wanted to know the reason for my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598"
					type="subject">arrest</term>.</p>
			<p>I received no reply. When I was <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-651" type="subject">released</term> the
				examining magistrate told me that he had never had a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject"
					>letter</term> from me, there had never been a file on me.</p>
			<p>On <date when="1946-10-02">2 October</date> I had a longer discussion with the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">guard</term> who was my boss. On the same day he
				brought me paper and ink, thus giving me the opportunity to submit a petition to the public prosecutor. He later handed it personally
				to the public prosecutor. Whenever he went off duty he took with him what I had written in order to give it back to me when he came to
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>. In this petition I described my
				fate in <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449" type="camp">Theresienstadt</placeName> and gave the
				names of about twenty <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czechs</placeName> who were in public life. The
				public prosecutor ordered these witnesses to be heard. Unfortunately they lived in different areas, all over <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/8505031/czechoslovakia.html">Czechoslovakia</placeName>, and of course I did not know their precise
				addresses. So the whole procedure took longer than expected. My file was sent to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3067695/hlavni-mesto-praha.html">Prague</placeName>, where the witness General Dr <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_pollak">Pollak</persName> was heard, then they came back to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071677/litomerice.html">Leitmeritz</placeName>. After that they were sent to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3078610/brno.html">Brünn</placeName> [<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3078610/brno.html"
					>Brno</placeName>]. When four of the witnesses named by me had been heard the public prosecutor did not want to listen to any
				others and ordered my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-651" type="subject">release</term>.</p>
			<p>On <date when="1947-01-09">9 January 1947</date> I was taken before the examining magistrate who said to me: <q>There is nothing here
					held against you, you may go wherever you wish. If you want to stay in <placeName
						ref="http://www.geonames.org/8505031/czechoslovakia.html">Czechoslovakia</placeName> there is no reason why you should not.

			<p>When I said to him that that would have been easier nineteen months ago, he replied: <q>I am not responsible for this. <pb n="15"
						facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560421_15.jpg"/> I did not even know that you existed. I have never seen your file, there isn’t one. There

					regular <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>. We dealt with those cases
					where the person concerned got in touch. The others did not get done. Unfortunately you were amongst these.</q> That was pretty
				cold comfort! When I told him that I would have expected my case to be first to be dealt with, he shrugged his shoulders. He said,
				however, that he could understand my anger, particularly since I had suffered so much. But that would not help me. I should try to get
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1043" type="subject">compensation</term> for wrongful <term

			<p>There I was on the street, without any <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">money</term>.
				An icy wind hit me. I did as the magistrate had suggested and went to the house he had described. And in this house lived a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">family</term>
				<persName ref="#ehri_et_bobeck">Bobeck</persName> with whom I had been in <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449" type="camp">Theresienstadt</placeName>. They did not know that I
				had been in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prison</term>, nor that I had been so
