								Knives. The SS was composed of the Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei, Waffen-SS,and Totenkopfverbaende. All police agencies
								were brought under the control of the SS in 1936. The Nuremberg Tribunal declared the SS to be a criminal organization

			<p>Protocol Number 107</p>
			<p>(Compiled on <date when="1940-01-05">January 5, 1940</date>)</p>
			<p>On <date when="1939-09-05">September 5, 1939</date>, our Jews in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html"
					>Łódź</placeName> volunteered en masse for the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004293"
					>military</orgName>. But there was no guarantee [to be enlisted] and they were not employed.</p>

			<p>En masse Jews took part in building trenches etc.</p>

			<p>The <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> invaded <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html"
					>Łódź</placeName> on <date when="1939-09-08">September 8</date> around 6pm. Only <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">small military units</orgName> arrived, who did not at all let the
				population feel their attitude towards them.</p>

			<p>The local <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> took in the invading <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
					>Germans</term> enthusiastically, welcoming them with flowers, offering them wine and pastries.</p>

			<p>The <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Polish</term> and Jewish <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">male</term> population in military age left <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> in masses in the night from <date when="1939-09-05">September
					5</date> to <date when="1939-09-06">6</date>.</p>

			<p>Officially, the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">German army</orgName> invaded <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> on <date when="1939-09-09">September 9</date> in the morning
				hours between 10 and 12.</p>

			<p>The streets were overcrowded with local <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> who welcomed the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">German army</orgName> with enthusiasm calling out <q>Heil <persName
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000185">Hitler</persName></q> etc. The <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> population was dressed festively. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> with top hats. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">women</term> in festive attire.</p>

			<p>There were also <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Poles</term> on the streets. On their faces one could read <pb n="2"
					facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_02.jpg"/> dreariness and feeling lost. They were acting calmly and restrained. Among the <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Polish</term> intelligentsia one could see sorrow. One could even see a tear in someone’s eye.
				The <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Polish</term> mob watched the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">military</orgName> indifferently and unaffected.</p>

			<p>Jews were not on the streets. I myself was walking on the streets with my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">eight-year old boy</term> because I was afraid to go
				out on my own. It was interesting to me to watch the scene. I was on <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html"
					>Wolnośćy Square</placeName> (<q><placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Freedom Square</placeName></q>).</p>

			<p>We were standing there for around 15 minutes – the consistent Heil exclamations became increasingly repulsive to me. I said to my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">boy</term> in <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles"
					>Polish</term>: <q>Come, let’s go!</q> Then a <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> standing behind me said to us: <q>Yes,
					yes, you can go. Here is no place for you.</q></p>

			<p>The stores were closed. The cafes open, but no one was inside. Life in the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html"
					>city</placeName> seemed to be dead anticipating what is to come.</p>

			<p>Shabbat and Sunday passed by with festive welcoming of the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">German
					army</orgName> by the local <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term> population.</p>

			<p>On <date when="1939-09-11">September 11</date> the stores were still closed.</p>

			<p>Already on <date when="1939-09-10">September 10</date> there were individual cases of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">looting</term> Jewish pastry and fruit shops. On the
					<date when="1939-09-11">11th</date>, big groups of local <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> of several
				hundred men each started to break open the locked doors, to bust open the display cabinets in the Jewish stores and to rob the
				merchandise. Groups of the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Polish</term> mob joined the <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term>. There were also individual <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
					>German</term>
				<orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">soldiers</orgName> among the assembled crowd.</p>

			<p><pb n="3" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_03.jpg"/> This lasted from Monday through Tuesday. They <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">looted</term> the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Pyetrikover, Novomayske</placeName> (<term

					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Zovadzke</placeName>, I was personally present when they <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">looted</term>
				<persName ref="#ehri_et_ogurek">Ogurek</persName>’s big shoe store.</p>

			<p>On <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Pyetrikover</placeName>, for instance, they <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-660" type="subject">pillaged</term>: <persName ref="#ehri_et_rapaport"
					>Rapaport</persName>’s big store for men’s hats, <persName ref="#ehri_et_hekhtkop">Hekhtkop</persName>’s shop for shoes, two
				stores of <orgName ref="#ehri_et_bata">Bata</orgName>.</p>

			<p>On <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Novomayske</placeName>: at number 19 there were big halls filled with
				different merchandise. There were 150 stores. Everything was thoroughly <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">looted</term>.</p>

			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-660" type="subject">robbed</term> merchandise was taken for personal
				use.</p>
			<p>There were cases when the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-660" type="subject">robbers</term> took several
				shoes – right or left. They stood in the middle of the crowd and cried out: <q>Who has shoes of this and that kind, for the left or
					right foot. Let’s exchange with each other.</q></p>

			<p>Jews were afraid to show themselves in the streets and they consequently did not react to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">looting</term>.</p>

			<p>On the streets, there was no <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-005429">police</orgName>, only the
					<q>civilian <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-657" type="subject">militia</term>,</q> from which the
				Jews had been immediately removed as soon as the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> invaded the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">city</placeName>. The civilian <term

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">looting</term> at all, watching it indifferently.</p>

			<p>There was not one case when Jews tried to rescue their property.</p>

			<p>If it incidentally occurred that a Jew went by, they did not beat him/her because the mob was too busy <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">looting</term>.</p>

			<p>It is estimated that around five hundred stores with textiles, shoes and haberdashery <pb n="4" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_04.jpg"/> have
				been entirely <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">looted</term>.</p>

			<p>On Tuesday, <date when="1939-09-12">September 12</date>, around noon, a Jewish delegation, led by <persName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000341">Rumkowski</persName>, who was designated as <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> chairman by the <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term>, turned to the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">German military commander</orgName>. (There was also <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_levshteyn">Levshteyn</persName> – a manufacturer – and a third one whose name I have forgotten.) The delegation
				requested that steps be taken so that the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject"
					>looting</term> stopps.</p>

			<p>The commander replied that when the Jews open the stores the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655"

			<p>On <date when="1939-09-13">September 13</date>, on Wednesday the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the <orgName

			<p>Since then, Jews keep their stores indeed open and do not pray collectively.</p>

			<p>As per the promise by the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term> municipal commander, that if the stores will be

			<p>The <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Polish</term> intelligentsia were deeply affected by <term

			<p>So, my neighbor, for instance, a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1128" type="subject">judge</term> from

			<p>One could feel such dejection in his words that is was unrealistic that he or any other <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles"

			<p>After Sukkot, the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> turned to the <term

			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> gathered around twenty
				Jews in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-758" type="subject">synagogue</term>, and the <term

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-701" type="subject">photographs</term> of the <q>praying Jews.</q></p>

			<p>As it is understood, the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> did this in order to show the world that they permit
				Jews to pray.</p>

			<p>Soon after the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term> invaded, they caught Jews both from the streets and the homes.
				They were forced to cover with naked hands the trenches which had been digged out for protection from bombs from airplanes.</p>

			<p>The <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> said during this: You took the biggest part in digging them out, now you
				have to fix what you have damaged.</p>

			<p>For the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>, the <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> did not pay anything. There were cases when the <term

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> and when cigarettes were distributed among
				them.</p>

			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> started to intervene
				saying Jews shouldn’t be snapped up for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>.
				The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> obligated itself to
				supply 700 Jews to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term> daily on the
				condition that Jews are no longer snapped from the streets and homes.</p>

			<p>In response, the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName> gave its consent. Nonetheless,
				Jews were still snapped from the streets to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject"
					>work</term>. From the homes, they were no longer dragged, though.</p>

			<p>As the consequence, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term>
				stopped to send people to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term> after a total

			<p>For a Jew – <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term> or <term

			<p>The relation to the caught Jews was better in the beginning when the regime in <placeName

			<p>One can say that the catching for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term> has

			<p>I myself was caught 3 times for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>.</p>

				Jewish <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">women</term>. We were given the task to clean
				and scrub the windows but they did not <pb n="9" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_09.jpg"/> give us any cloth. We were forced to get undressed
				and to take off our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">underwear</term> and to clean

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">working</term> this way from 9:30am to 1pm.</p>

			<p>From my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">coat</term>, which stayed downstairs, nothing

					type="subject">letter</term> from the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/597427/republic-of-lithuania.html"
					>Lithuanian</placeName> consulate in my pocket. When I exited the building of the <q><orgName

			<p>On my way back home, there is an <q>assembly point for <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term>
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-304" type="subject">refugees</term></q> (non-Jews). I did not manage

					>Moler</persName>, a 57-years old traveling salesman, requested to let me go. <q>Good</q>, the <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German </term>said, <q>but you will have to <term

				And so it was: <persName ref="#ehri_et_moler">Moler </persName>was carrying coal for himself, and for me, he was scrubbing floors.</p>

			<p>Such <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term> was not necessary at all. The only

			<p>4-6 weeks after the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> invaded <placeName

					facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_11.jpg"/> started pouring out every day. All Jews had to report how much they owned. One was allowed to

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1033" type="subject">decree</term> [is issued]. The small shops were
				automatically closed down this way. The bigger company <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-890"
					type="subject">factories</term> and warehouses were occupied by <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term>
				commissioners – so-called “<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-590" type="subject">depositaries</term>.” The
				whole power was de facto transferred to the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term> commissioner, and the real owner
				was nothing more than mere observer in his own store. In a big <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-890"
					type="subject">factory</term> or store, the owner received approximately 200 Złoty per week and the rest of the money was
				transferred to the <q><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-931" type="subject">blocked account</term></q>. In

					personnel</orgName> and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-763" type="subject">Christians</term>. To
				Jews, one was not permitted to sell anything. In this transaction, the Jewish owner only took on the role of an observer. He did not
				collect the money. The Jewish money on the <q><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-931" type="subject"
						>blocked accounts</term></q> was put into different <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-930"

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-930" type="subject">banking houses</term> where Jews usually did not

					>Łódź</placeName>.</p>

			<p>Coinciding with the large scale industry, the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> also destroyed Jewish small
				industry and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-933" type="subject">Jewish retail trading</term>. On
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Vskhadnye Street</placeName>, for example, the Jews were <term

					type="subject">trade</term> on the street is banned.</p>

			<p>Another order was published that all Jewish coachmans have to give away their horse-drawn coaches together with the horses; the Jews in

			<p>On <date when="1939-11-05">November 5, 1939</date>, a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1033"

					>Christian</term> stores are prohibited to sell anything to Jews. And one had to <pb n="12" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_12.jpg"/> put

					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-763" type="subject">Christian</term> friends to buy shoes etc. for
				him.</p>

			<p>Also the peasants, who come to the city <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>, were forced not to
				sell anything to a Jew. The peasants secretly sold Jews <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
					type="subject">food</term> and did not take more money for it.</p>

			<p>In every sense, Jews were in a very difficult situation because <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
					type="subject">food</term> was not sold to them in the stores cheaper and they were being chased out of the lines [in front of the
				stores]. The life of the Jews was literally paralyzed.</p>

			<p>All buildings of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-879" type="subject">Jewish schools</term> were soon
				occupied by the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> and the Jewish <term

			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">Yellow Badge</term></p>

			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1033" type="subject">decree</term> regarding the <term

			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1033" type="subject">decree</term> says that Jews – <term

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">death</term> penalty.</p>

			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1033" type="subject">decree</term> had a dreadful effect on the
				Jewish population. The <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Polish</term> intelligentsia felt very sorry for the Jews. The <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Polish</term> mob, in contrast, reacted to the Jews with their <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">yellow badges</term> with a mocking smile on their
				faces.</p>

			<p><pb n="13" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_13.jpg"/> Older local <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> pretended that they
				do not see the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">yellow badge</term>. The younger
				local <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> reacted to it with content.</p>

			<p>Jews that had converted to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-763" type="subject">Christianity</term> did
				not wear any <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">badge</term>.</p>

			<p>Around <date when="1939-11-10">November 10</date>, a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1033" type="subject"
					>decree</term> came out pursuant to which it was prohibited to walk on <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html"
					>Pyetrykover Street</placeName>. Jews who lived on <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Pyetrykover
					Street</placeName> had to buy passing permits for 20 Złoty per month. They were allowed to walk on <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Pyetrykover Street</placeName> only until 11am.</p>

			<p>This created huge difficulties for the Jewish population in their everyday life since the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Pyetrykover Street</placeName> cuts through the whole city and one has to cross
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Pyetrykover Street</placeName> in order to make one’s way on one or the
				other side.</p>

			<p>Jews used to take a risk and jumped over from one street corner to the other side. This always ended in getting beaten up heavily and
				even in getting <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598" type="subject">arrested</term> because on all
				street corners <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004312">police guards</orgName> or <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">SS men</orgName> were standing. To this day, the <term

					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> are overcrowded with Jews, even with <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">women</term> and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">children</term> who sinned by crossing <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Pyetrykover Street</placeName>. To this day, no one of the detainees has been
				released. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> intervened but
				without success.</p>

			<p>Around <date when="1939-11-13">November 13</date>, a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1033" type="subject"
					>decree</term> appeared that Jews are allowed to walk [on the streets] from 8am to 5pm.</p>

			<p>In the morning, the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> used to turn back the pointer on their watches by a few
				minutes or, in the evening, turn it forward and they <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598" type="subject"
					>arrested</term> Jews accusing them of being on the street too early or of walking around too late.</p>

			<p><pb n="14" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_14.jpg"/> And the detainees have not been released to this day. Relatives of the detainees were
				refused any information and were told to leave threatening them that they will arrest those intervening as well.</p>

			<p>People became aware of the detainees only because the detainees, who receive parcels from outside three times per week, usually took
				pains to get out slips of paper with the names of those who are detained with the receptacles.</p>

			<p><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">Food</term> and warm <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term> were permitted. <term

					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prisons</term> on Tuesdays, Thursdays and
				Shabbats – on all of these days, one could see large numbers of Jews in front of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prisons</term>.</p>

			<p>Soon, in the first days, after the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> had invaded <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>, Jews started to be kicked out of their apartments.</p>

			<p>This happened in the following way:</p>


			<p>1) The <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> – <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">military people</orgName>, led by civilian local <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> – usually entered a Jewish apartment and ordered them to leave [their
				apartment] within two hours. They were only allowed to take things except for furniture.</p>
			<p>2) They usually came into Jewish apartments and ordered [the Jews] to leave the apartment – without any right to take anything with
				them.</p>
			<p>3) They usually entered the apartments of rich Jews – ordered them to leave the apartment within 2 hours and to take things – except
				for furniture. When the residents went out with their things, a guard, a soldier or <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">SS man</orgName>, was usually standing in front of the gate and they
				took the things away from the Jews.</p>
			<p>4) Also, they occupied whole residential blocks with apartments of very poor Jews. There, the <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> prepared apartments for the Baltic <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
					>Germans</term>. They forced [the Jews] to <pb n="15" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_15.jpg"/> clean up the apartments, to put fresh
				sheets on the beds. They were not permitted to take anything with them.</p>


			<p>All Jews living on <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Magistratske Street 20, 21, 22</placeName>, for instance,
				were kicked out like that. The apartments stand empty to this day because the Baltic <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
					>Germans</term> haven’t arrived yet.</p>

			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">looting</term> of Jewish apartments started in
				the early days of the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>, which has taken on a much more systematic nature. They even
				carry furniture out of the apartments. There is almost no Jewish house from which they haven’t carried out underwear, <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term> or furniture and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> yet.</p>

			<p>In the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">looting</term>, higher officers participated
				as much as <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-657" type="subject">militiamen</term>, <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1097" type="subject">soldiers</term> and civilians with <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-369" type="subject">swastika</term>.</p>

			<p>The local <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> usually pointed to the rich Jewish houses. Allegedly, they were
				searching for weapons but in doing so they took all the valuable things.</p>

			<p>For example, in the first <date when="1939-10">October</date> days, they <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-660" type="subject">robbed</term> from <persName ref="#ehri_et_glas"
					>Glas</persName> (<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Koperniko Street 23</placeName>) – looking for
				weapons – beautiful furs. On <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Narutovitsha Street 47</placeName>, in
				engineer <persName ref="#ehri_et_fromes">Fromes</persName>’ house, they <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-660" type="subject">robbed</term> a bigger sum of money and pulled off 2
				diamond rings from the fingers, and from the wrist – a golden watch.</p>

			<p>In the first days of <date when="1939-12">December</date>, they surrounded the streets <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Paludnyave, Kilinski, Pamarske</placeName>. They allegedly searched for <q>secret
					radio stations</q> and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-660" type="subject">robbed</term> the Jewish
				apartments.</p>

			<p>In the streets of <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> one can see now how the masses of poorest
					<term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> are dressed elegantly in furs. Their apartments are opulently
				furnished.</p>

			<p>
				<pb n="16" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_16.jpg"/> One could also see on the streets in evening hours, at dusk, how uniformed <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1097" type="subject">soldier</term> and civilian <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> with <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-369"
					type="subject">swastika</term> led Jews through the gates, ostensibly looking for weapons, ordering them to lift the hands and
				taking watches, briefcases, money and generally valuable objects.</p>

			<p>In the first days of <date when="1939-12">December</date>, my neighbor, the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-890" type="subject">factory</term> owner <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_frenkl_volf">Volf Frenkl</persName>, <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Magistratske
					25</placeName>, was stopped in his gateway and when they searched him, they took away a briefcase with 400 Złoty.</p>

			<p><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1097" type="subject">Soldiers</term> used to stop Jewish <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">women</term> as well asking how much money they had
				threatening them that if they understate the sum, <q>it will be bad.</q> The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1097" type="subject">soldiers</term> used to take all of the money which

			<p>On the basis of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1033" type="subject">decrees</term>, they used to take
				out all the goods of full warehouses.</p>

			<p>For example, they took away all the merchandise at the end of <date when="1939-11">November</date> here:</p>

			<p>They systematically emptied the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-890" type="subject">factory</term>

			<p>During the first days, it seemed that the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> were not interested in social and

			<p>The<orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo-chief</orgName>: Who are you?</p>

			<p><persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000341">Rumkowski</persName>: I am the <q>Elder</q> from the

			<p>The <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo-chief</orgName>: Ah, since you are the Elder of the

			<p>He gave a sign and the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo agents</orgName> started to beat

			<p>In the middle of this scene, the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">military city

			<p><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">Military city commander</orgName>: I, the <orgName

			<p><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo chief</orgName>: Where is a <q>sir</q> here?</p>

			<p><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">The city commander</orgName>: The sir who was nominated by me to

			<p><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo chief</orgName>: I don’t know a sir here whatsoever, this

			<p><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">The city commander</orgName>: The sir is untouchable and you are

			<p><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo chief</orgName>: Right now, he is not untouchable. In any

			<p><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">The city commander</orgName>: No, the sir is my Jew and I ask for

			<p>They both went into an office.</p>

			<p>In the meantime, <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000341">Rumkowski</persName> did not recover from

			<p>The <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo chief</orgName> feared that <persName

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-287" type="subject">doctor</term> who examined him and gave him

			<p>What the two <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> discussed amongst each other in the office is not known. After

			<p>The five <q>buriers</q> were present during the whole time of the conversation. Disregarding the prohibition not to tell anyone about

			<p>Before <date when="1939-11-11">November 11</date>, the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> blew up the <placeName

			<p><pb n="23" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_23.jpg"/> Amongst the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Poles</term>, this led to a dreadful
				agitation.</p>

			<p>The <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> were eagerly looking for the <orgName

			<p>The expulsion of the Jews from the environs of <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName></p>

			<p>In the middle of the month of <date when="1939-11-15">November</date>, around the <date when="1939-11-15">15th</date>, news made their
				way to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> that the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
					>Germans</term> expulse the Jews from the border cities and from the cities that were incorporated into the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159" type="subject">German Reich</term>.</p>

			<p>The first city from where Jews were expelled was <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html">Kalisz</placeName>.</p>

			<p>The expulsion from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html">Kalisz</placeName></p>

			<p>Thirteen thousand (13.000) Jews lived in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html">Kalisz</placeName>. From the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-304" type="subject">refugees</term> from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html">Kalisz</placeName>, who came to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>, we learned in detail how the expulsion of the Jews was carried
				out.</p>

			<p><placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html">Kalisz</placeName> Jews were sitting at home not suspecting any <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1033" type="subject">decree</term> [to be issued]. The female guard of the
				house appeared in front of the Jews and announced that they should gather in the yard. The Jews came down immediately as they were
				dressed, some <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">women</term> in their dressing gowns.
				One quickly threw over a coat. In the yard, a <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term> patrol was already standing who
				led the Jews to the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html">market square</placeName>. He did not allow the Jews
				to go back up home and to take something with them. This was the way it happened in many houses.</p>

			<p>When there were already three thousand Jews on the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html">market
					square</placeName>, the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> started to chase them in a hurry and with
				bayonets. They chased them far outside the city screaming: <q>Forward because we are shooting.</q> This way, they chased them for
				approximately twenty kilometres, young and old. Afterwards, the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> said that
				who dares and comes back to the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html">city</placeName> will be <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">shot</term>. All apartments from the expelled were
				sealed. All of this went on for three days in a row. In the course of these three days, the whole <pb n="24"
					facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_24.jpg"/> Jewish population from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html"
					>Kalisz</placeName> was expelled. The Jews were wandering through the neighboring cities and a part of them arrived in the
					<q>protectorat.</q></p>

			<p>A large part of the expelled from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html">Kalisz</placeName> arrived in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> took care of them, gave them
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>, but one cannot speak of bigger help
				because, at that time, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term>
				in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> already did not have the funds.</p>

			<p><term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Poles</term> were not expelled from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html">Kalisz</placeName> at all.</p>

			<p>From <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3095321/konin.html">Konin</placeName>, the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
					>Germans</term> expelled both <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Poles</term> and Jews and afterwards from all cities in
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3088388/pomerania.html">Pomerania</placeName>, Vigdinye<note place="bottom"
					>Uncertain.</note>, <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3088171/poznan.html">Poznań</placeName>, <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3099434/gdansk.html">Gdańsk</placeName>, Poyrn <note place="bottom">Uncertain.</note>, <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3102014/bydgoszcz.html">Bydgoszcz</placeName> – all Jews were expelled from there and also <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Poles</term> en masse.</p>

			<p>I also learned that the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> threatened all Jews from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3080414/zdunska-wola.html">Zduńska Wola</placeName> with an expulsion if they do not pay a
				contribution of about five million Złoty. They payed a part of the contribution and the expulsion was stopped for the time being.</p>

			<p>After that, the bigger part of the Jewish population (roughly two thirds) was expelled from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3089578/pabianice.html">Pabianice</placeName> near <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>. Jews were mainly chased from the bigger streets. This took place
				in the beginning of <date>November</date>.</p>

			<p>People also talked about that there will be an expulsion of Jews from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html"
					>Łódź</placeName> but the Jews consoled themselves that it cannot come to that because it is technically impossible. After all,
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> counts a quarter million Jews!</p>

			<p>Expulsion from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName></p>

			<p>On <date when="1939-12-11">December 11</date>, early in the morning, we learned that on <pb n="25" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_25.jpg"/>
				the building of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> there is
				a placard hanging in <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Polish</term> and <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
					>German</term> saying that <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> will become <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-626" type="subject">judenrein</term>
				<note>free from Jews</note> and that the Jews have to leave the city voluntarily or that they have to register with the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> which will take care of
				sending them off from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>. No deadline was indicated. I
				learned that <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000341">Rumkowski</persName>, the head of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> nominated by the <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term>, called upon the Jews on the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-890" type="subject">factory</term>
				<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">railway station</placeName> that they should leave <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>.</p>

			<p>Afterwards I got to know from a clerk from the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish
					community</term> how it came to that. A day earlier, the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350"
					>Gestapo</orgName> informed the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish
					community</term> that the city <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> has to become <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-626" type="subject">judenrein</term> and that they, the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName>, will carry it out on their own. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> started to request that it
				should get the possibility to enforce it methodically, not en masse and not at once. The <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName> replied that they will do a test: if the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> sends off eight thousand Jews
				in the course of 4 days (two thousand a day), the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350"
					>Gestapo</orgName> will allow that everything should be carried out by the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term>. And indeed: soon, on the
				first day, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> began to work
				energetically on it. The yard of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish
					community</term> was literally sieged. First of all, the Jewish poor registered because the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> gave 50 Złoty (25 <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term> Mark) per <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819"
					type="subject">family</term> and the poor who did not have anything were eager to get it.</p>

			<p>The first who registered had to come to the <q>gathering point,</q> which were determined by the <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> – and from there, they were sent off to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3087516/radogoszcz.html">Radogoszcz</placeName> [<term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669" type="subject">prison</term>], where they were held for three days.
				There they had to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term> and the Germans also
				carried out searches through their stuff. The <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> also did x-rays in order to
				make sure that the Jews had not swallowed any diamonds. One was allowed to take the following: one pair of underwear, one suit of
				clothes, one pair of shoes, a few pairs of socks, a fork, spoon, knife, one pillow, one blanket, one bedsheet and 25 Mark in the
				wallet.</p>

			<p><pb n="26" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_26.jpg"/> The first group consisted of five hundred individuals.</p>

			<p>On the second day, already two thousand five hundred individuals were leaving, and the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> was constantly sieged by Jews
				who were eager to leave the earlier the better.</p>

			<p>From <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3087516/radogoszcz.html">Radogoszcz</placeName>, the Jews from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> were put into <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522" type="subject">sealed-up train waggons</term> and sent off in an
				unknown direction. Only after two weeks, we in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> learned
				about their fate, but on that later.</p>

			<p>In the first two days of the expulsion, <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> looked like in the
				most horrific scene in a film. On all streets, one could see rows of waggons and buses which moved slowly with people and stuff on
				them. The freezing weather was dreadful. Everyone wanted to leave the city as soon as possible in all kinds of ways.</p>

			<p>In <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>, there are two <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">train stations</placeName>. The <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html">Kalisz</placeName>
				<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">train station</placeName> was now designated exclusively for the <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term>. So, for Jews, the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-890" type="subject">factory</term>
				<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">train station</placeName> remained. There, scenes out of Dante took place.
				There were cases when the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">shot</term> into the queue in which Jews were
				standing to buy tickets. Three Jews were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">shot
					dead</term> in situations like that.</p>

			<p>If the first two days were already terrifying, the third day of the expulsion was even more horrible. This is the case because, in the
				night from Wednesday to Thursday (<date when="1939-12-13">December 13, 1939</date>), the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
					>Germans</term> surrounded a few streets like <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Zgyerzsher,
					Lushamirsker</placeName>, and entered the Jewish apartments and ordered the Jews to leave everything behind within five minutes
				and to come with them. There were cases when <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject"
					>mothers</term> did not succeed in dress their infants properly. They chased the Jews with their <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">families</term> dressed as they were to the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">train station</placeName>, crammed them <pb n="27"
					facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_27.jpg"/> into <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522" type="subject"
					>sealed-up train waggons</term> and sent them off in an unknown direction.</p>

			<p>When we got to know about it the next day in the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">city,</placeName> a
				terrible panic erupted. Through the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish
					community</term>, it was still possible to take something with you. Those who got displaced directly by the <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term>, they went away naked and bare. The rich ran away with taxis and on buses. For
				a spot on a bus to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/756135/warsaw.html">Warsaw</placeName>, one paid from 500 to 1000
				Złoty.</p>

			<p>The poor, who could not go with buses, jump on waggons from the <q>Warthegau</q> (the part that was annexed to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159" type="subject">German Reich</term>) to the border of the
				protectorate to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3099180/glowno.html">Głowno</placeName>, approximately 35 kilometres away from
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>.</p>

			<p>Without any means and possibilities to go on, they were stuck there. There were probably around eight thousand Jews there. Since
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3099180/glowno.html">Głowno</placeName> is a small shtetl, and there was nowhere to spend
				the night, the expelled Jews from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> lingered on the fields
				and in the forests in the freezing cold. The consequences were catastrophic: in the course of one night, 400 <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">children</term> froze to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">death</term>.</p>

			<p>The relationship from the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles">Polish</term> peasants to the Jewish expellees was a good one. They
				took the Jews in into cottages and gave them food for free. But the stream [of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-101" type="subject">refugees</term>] was so big that the peasants’ help
				did not suffice. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> in
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> was so helpless that it did not send anyone to
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3099180/glowno.html">Głowno</placeName>.</p>

			<p>On Friday, <date when="1939-12-15">December 15</date>, in the morning, the rich Jews from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> gathered on <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Bałut Market</placeName> – in the true Jewish center – and shouted: <q>Jews, take
					money and jewelry.</q> And they simply threw diamonds on the street. The Jews did not take it, though, because they said <pb
					n="28" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_28.jpg"/> to the rich: <q>The same danger that threatens you threatens us. A Jew is prohibited to
					have on him jewelry and money,</q> and they did not take the money and jewelry.</p>

			<p>In the night from Friday to Shabbat (from the <date when="1939-12-15">15th</date> to the <date when="1939-12-16">16th</date>), mass
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598" type="subject">arrests</term> among the intelligentsia began,
				among <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-287" type="subject">doctors</term>, lawyers, teachers – both Jews
				and non-Jews. People were thinking that these were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598" type="subject"
					>arrests</term>. In fact, this was an expulsion. Within five minutes, all <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">families</term> from these detainees were sent off in
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522" type="subject">sealed-up train cars</term>. When, by
				coincidence, there was a stranger in the home of such an intelligent, a stranger who does not belong to that category, they sent him
				off as well.</p>

			<p>There were eight cases when people were severely <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject"
					>ill</term> and they could not be sent off – so the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> sealed up the
				apartments. The ones sealed-up remained confined like that for ten days. The neighbors heard the cries from the wretched ones. One
				froze from the cold, also the pipes from the water conduit froze so that there was no water. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> constantly intervened at the
					<orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName> but without success. Only on the tenth
				day, the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName> permitted to open the sealed-up
				apartments: in these apartments, one found two dead persons and the rest was unconscious and in terrible conditions.</p>

			<p>The expulsion of the Jews as well as the mass exodus lasted until Sunday morning, <date when="1939-12-17">December 17, 1939</date>.</p>

			<p>In the morning, news circulated fast as lightning across the city that the expulsion was stopped.</p>

			<p>I soon went to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> and they
				told me that on Shabbat in the afternoon, at four o’clock, a delegation from the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term>, namely <persName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000341">Rumkowski</persName>’s <pb n="29"
					facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_29.jpg"/> representative Dr. <persName ref="#ehri_et_helman">Helman</persName>, the female lawyer
					<persName ref="#ehri_et_plivatska">Plivatska</persName> and a third person, went to the commander of the city with the request
				that they should alleviate the expulsion. The Jewish delegation listed all the horror and consequences of the expulsion. The Jewish
				delegation was received by the commander of the city in the corridor and with a strict tone he said: <q>The Jews have to leave the
					city en masse. <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> has to become <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-626" type="subject">judenrein</term>! If the number of Jews who will
					leave <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> will be satisfying, the <term
						ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> won’t be dragging Jews from their apartments.</q> With this, the Jewish
				delegation left thinking that their intervention did not lead to anything.</p>

			<p>Around midnight on Shabbat, there was a telephone call for <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000341"
					>Rumkowski</persName>’s representative <hi rend="u">Dr.</hi>
				<persName ref="#ehri_et_helman">Helman</persName>. The content of the call was: <q>Please tell the Jews that they should not leave
						<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>.</q> Dr. <persName ref="#ehri_et_helman"
					>Helman</persName> began to ask for how long the expulsion will be halted but he didn’t receive any reply.</p>

			<p>On Sunday morning, the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">city</placeName> learned about it and different
				rumors started to circulate. They said that it is temporary, as long as the freezing weather holds sway. Also that the expulsion is
				halted until <date when="1940-03-01">March 1</date>. Others said that it was an intervention from America which threatened that it
				will expel the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> from there on ships; others assured that it happened because
				it was technically impossible to send off such a big number of individuals because all paths were clogged up by the coaches and
				buses.</p>

			<p>The Jews from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> felt relieved. We kissed each other on the
				streets and wished <q>mazl-tov.</q> But nonetheless, the Jews from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html"
					>Łódź</placeName> continued to leave the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">city</placeName> in great
				numbers.</p>

			<p>The Jews from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> do not believe that the expulsion has been
				called off for good. They think that the halt of the expulsion is temporary because the official <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term> offices have not given any formal announcement. The panic to escape was <pb
					n="30" facs="EHRI-ET-WL05320107_30.jpg"/> not as frenzied as before but people still left the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">city</placeName> en masse.</p>

			<p>The nervousness amongst the Jews of <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> which has decreased a
				little was renewed again ten days later when we learned that the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> started to
				expel the Jews from neighboring cities like <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3089578/pabianice.html">Pabianice</placeName>,
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3104132/aleksandrow-lodzki.html">Aleksandrów (Łódzki)</placeName>, <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3095277/konstantynow-lodzki.html">Konstantynów (Łódzki)</placeName>, <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3095277/konstantynow-lodzki.html">Zg</placeName><placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3095277/konstantynow-lodzki.html">ierz</placeName> and other shtetlekh surrounding <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>.</p>

			<p>The Jews in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> once again had a nervous night [leyl-shimurim =
				holiday eve, esp. the first night of Passover]. We were anxious. We were afraid that the expulsion would start anew because the roads
				were emptier again.</p>

			<p>On Shabbat, <date when="1939-12-30">December 30, 1939</date>, I drove out of <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html"
					>Łódź</placeName> and I don’t know anything about the subsequent fate of the people from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>.</p>

			<p>Regarding the expelled Jews from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3099180/glowno.html">Głowno</placeName>, I learned that only later – after two weeks after the
				expulsion – the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> sent the expelled Jews to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/562153/galicia.html">Galicia</placeName>, in small shtetlekh, in barracks à 1000 individuals, on
				stony floors.</p>

			<p>From the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-872" type="subject">Jewish community</term> circle in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName>, I got to know things that were not known in the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">city</placeName>, namely: that the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598" type="subject">arrested</term> Jews were <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject">tortured</term>; they pulled out of their mouths
				golden teeth and crowns and there were also cases of castration.</p>

			<p>I learned in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093133/lodz.html">Łódź</placeName> that the <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> also expelled the Jews from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3079897/zychlin.html">Żychlin</placeName>, which belongs to the protectorate, in the same way they
				did in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3096880/kalisz.html">Kalisz</placeName>. This time, the <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> let packs of dogs chase after the Jews.</p>
