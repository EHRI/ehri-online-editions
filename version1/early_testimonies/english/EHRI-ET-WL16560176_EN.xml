			<p>Finally, her friends gave her the address of a young secretary who had helped her boss to <term

					>Schubert</persName>, the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName> boss; he wanted

			<p>Mother and daughter waited all day for the call to say when <persName ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz">Fritz</persName> could set off. On

					type="subject">guesthouse</term> opposite the station. Fritzi, who delivered this message, went on to explain that <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz">Smetana</persName> had called her from her bed at 10pm, because he needed <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">money</term> in order to purchase the necessary <term

				making it known that they were planning to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject"
					>escape</term>. In the evening, a long distance call from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3071407/luhacovice.html"
					>Luhacovice</placeName> surprised them, which she didn’t want to take at first, <persName ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz"
					>Fritz</persName> called, he had the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-203" type="subject"

			<p>Shortly after 5am, they left the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">house</term>. The

			<p>Before we could ask any questions, he left. A few minutes later, along came a very blonde, plump <term

				under the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1069" type="subject">newspaper</term> that was lying on the

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName>, and explained other things; she seemed fairly
				well-informed. Then <q><persName ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz">Fritz</persName></q> returned. <q>Everything is organised. A friend of
					mine owns a cinema, he has a cinema here, another in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3060077/holic.html"
					>Holíč</placeName>, that is the next village, over the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3057568/slovak-republic.html"
						>Slovakian</placeName> border. Due to this, he can travel back and forth over the border as he pleases. We’ll get a taxi to

			<p>Then we sat in the taxi and waited. A <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term> came

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-799" type="subject">journalist</term>, he got into the car too and the

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1097" type="subject">soldiers</term> drove past on motorbikes. Lots of

					>Czech</placeName> car brand) came along and stopped a few metres away. A <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term> got out, and <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz">Fritz</persName> and the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/597427/republic-of-lithuania.html"
					>Lithuanian</placeName> went over to him. Then, the three <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826"

					>Fritz</persName></q> came back, got into the car and told the driver he should drive right up to the other car. Then he gave us
				two exit <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject">passes</term> (the pink tickets for
				so-called ‘small border traffic’, which permitted the holders to travel back and forth between border areas, for work purposes, for

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">hotel</term> entrance stood the other car, with its
				bonnet facing us. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> – there were two of

					ref="http://www.geonames.org/597427/republic-of-lithuania.html">Lithuanian</placeName> went too, then came a porter who took our
				luggage out of the taxi and into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">hotel</term>.
				After a while, the Porter carried our suitcase out of the building and to the other car. Then, <term

				suitcases. It got dark. <persName ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz">Fritz Smetana</persName> said goodbye, giving us lots of assurance.</p>
			<p>Then the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/597427/republic-of-lithuania.html">Lithuanian</placeName> came along and started
				looking for something on the ground, turning every bit of paper lying on the street over with his foot, said <q>Everything is

				we waited. Finally, three <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> came out of the

				guy. The <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">German</placeName> produced our papers, he
				already had the border ticket and the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject"
					>passports</term>, and said that we shouldn’t worry and we should only speak if we were asked questions.</p>
			<pb n="5" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560176_05.jpg"/>
			<p>So finally we set off.</p>
			<p>After ten minutes, a barrier was laid down on the road, we were trapped at the border. The barrier was taken up, we drove through, and
				it was laid down again directly after we had passed. Now there was no going back anymore. In front of us was a big, elegant car and
				the passengers came out of the border office, and put individual pieces of their expensive <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothing</term> back into the car. That implied a very

			<p><q>Your <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject">passports</term> please</q>, a <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">German</placeName> voice said, and suddenly a <placeName

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1097" type="subject">soldier</term> was standing before us. Although we
				were on the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/8505031/czechoslovakia.html">Czechoslovakian</placeName> border, there were no
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czech</placeName> officials anywhere to be seen. Our <orgName

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> took the <term

						<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">ladies</term> with me too</q>, he said,

				<q>Thirty <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">koruna</term></q>, the two of us said.
					<q>Check the handbags</q>, suggests a small, unsympathetic <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826"
					type="subject">man</term> to our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1097" type="subject"
					>soldiers</term>. I took mine our first, he looked through all the pockets, finally he got to the small purse, in which I kept
				both suitcase keys, and I told him that in a polite manner. He only asked whether I had these suitcases in the car, and gave the bag
				back to me, then afterwards he searched Mutzi’s bag, checked our permits to travel across the border, and we drove over the bridge to
				the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3057568/slovak-republic.html">Slovakian</placeName> border office. With the border
				officials there, our two companions just made silly jokes, showed our <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject">passes</term>, then the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3057568/slovak-republic.html">Slovakian</placeName> shone a bright torch at us, and we drove on into
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3057568/slovak-republic.html">Slovakian</placeName> land.</p>
			<p><q>So, we are over the border</q> said our <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term>. Mutzi let out a breath and I felt much
				lighter. I wondered whether we were away from the Nazis forever now. We drove on for about another quarter of an hour, on a very
				pretty road to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3060077/holic.html">Holíč</placeName>, the next village. There, we stopped
				outside the only <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">guesthouse</term> in this tiny
				village, and got out of the car.</p>
			<p><q>So, you must stay here and wait for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject"
						>passports</term>, which I can hopefully bring back for you as early as tomorrow</q>, the cinema-owner said. The <orgName

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term> took my bracelet out of the bag and some
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">money</term>, which he gave to us, then he
				booked a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">room</term> for us and went into the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">guesthouse</term> with us. I felt like I was dreaming.
				Did that really all happen?</p>
			<p>While we were waiting for our evening <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">meal</term>, we
				chatted to our travelling companions. <q>I wanted to say one more thing to you</q>, the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term> said. <q>Most importantly, you are very
					near the border and border surveillance is patrolling constantly, so show yourselves in public as little as possible, otherwise
					you might attract attention. The best thing would be to stay in your <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">room</term>. As identification, you have the
					permit to cross the border with you, and if anyone happens to ask, though I am quite sure that no one will, then say that you are
					going to my sister’s wedding, but you have to wait here because there is a problem with the car.</q></p>
			<pb n="6" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560176_06.jpg"/>
			<p><q>My sister’s name is Soundse, and she lives two villages on. You know, today I was really sweating, I felt like I was sitting on hot
					coals, and when I feel like that, then it really means something.</q> And then he asked Mutzi: <q>What did you take out of your
					bag while the official was searching your <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject"
						>daughter</term>? I did see you do it, lucky that the official didn’t see, because you know, if they get suspicious then
					things really do get difficult.</q> Mutzi explained to him that it was only a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">Franc</term>, which she had happened to find in her
				bag, and that she had left it in the car. But, anyway, we had got through alright.</p>
			<p>The <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">German</placeName> went on to explain to us that
				he had driven through the whole previous night to get us the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/719819/hungary.html"
					>Hungarian</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject">visa</term> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3343955/bratislava.html">Bratislava</placeName>. Then, he told us again not to repeat anything that
				he had told us. <q>You see, we want to go on to help others too.</q> He came from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2951839/bavaria.html">Bavaria</placeName>, and really was a nice <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term>. The other <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term> promised us he would give the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject">passports</term> to <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz">Fritz</persName> straight away, so he could set off for <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3067696/prague.html">Prague</placeName> that evening and aim to be back by the following evening. And
				then they said their goodbyes.</p>
			<p>Then we were left sitting there, in the little <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3057568/slovak-republic.html"
					>Slovakian</placeName> village, we ate a little something again and told the landlord that we would like to have tomorrow’s <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">meals</term> delivered to our <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">room</term>, and then we went upstairs. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">room</term> looked nice and clean, and, most
				importantly, we hoped to only have to stay there for one night. It had become quite late and we went straight to bed. We had certainly
				been through enough that day. Although we were tired, neither of us could sleep, but we did not tell each other this, as neither of us
				wanted to disturb the other, but, as we lay there in the dark, the situation first began to sink in for me properly. Now, we were over
				the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3057568/slovak-republic.html">Slovakian</placeName> border, without <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject">passports</term>, with only a small amount of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">money</term>, relying completely on the honesty of two
				strange <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term>; what would happen if <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz">Fritz</persName> didn’t get the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146"
					type="subject">visa</term>, if they didn’t bring us the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141"
					type="subject">passports</term>, if someone here suspected, etc. etc… Mutzi was probably wondering about exactly the same things.
				Nevertheless, we both got up cheerfully the next morning, and neither of us mentioned any of our worries, but instead reminded each
				other how good it was that we were over the border, and that <persName ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz">Fritz</persName> would hopefully
				take us over the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/719819/hungary.html">Hungarian</placeName> border that evening, as he had
				promised. In my head, I kept trying to calculate the distance between <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3075654/hodonin.html"
					>Hodonin</placeName> and <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3067696/prague.html">Prague</placeName>, and had a shock when it
				occurred to me what a huge distance it was. Maybe <persName ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz">Fritz</persName> had not been seen straight
				away at the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1118" type="subject">embassy</term> – but there was no point
				in thinking about that so much. After <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
					>breakfast</term> we sorted some things out, and then we had nothing left to do.</p>

			<pb n="7" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560176_07.jpg"/>
			<p><q>Mutzi, we won’t decide anything now – we can see what to do with the <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">money</term> tomorrow, when we’re on the <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940" type="subject">train</term></q>, I said. So, we went downstairs
				to see the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">hotel</term> manager, to tell him that we
				were leaving early and to ask whether we could be driven to the station. We paid our bill, and went to bed. Or, more accurately, we
				laid down and began to try and decide what the best thing to do tomorrow would be. Of course, we did not tell each other of our
				concerns, instead we both tried to convince ourselves that everything would be fine.</p>
			<p>It was all quite ridiculous – Mutzi and I were really lying in a tiny <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">hotel</term> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3060077/holic.html">Holíč</placeName>, (naturally, I had never heard the name of this place before in

					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3067696/prague.html">Prague</placeName>, our <term

				(brother and sister, as mentioned earlier in the report)<note place="bottom">Slightly unclear here, though it seems Fietz and Lisinka
					are likely the friends in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/719819/hungary.html">Hungary</placeName> mentioned on page
					2</note>, I had to keep reminding myself of that, as it helped me to regain my courage. On top of that, there was no going back
				for us anymore, as we had finally got over the border. Why shouldn’t we take the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">money</term> with us, anyway? It was our <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-945" type="subject">property</term>, and we had had to leave everything
				else behind, and why – just because one <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term>
				had gone crazy and wanted to take over the world. and had cause more harm than you could even comprehend. When I thought about that;

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-234" type="subject">illegally</term> across the border, I got quite
				worked up – but it really was not that bad. Let’s worry about that later – it’s still a whole day away, and we can wait until then to
				see what we’ll have to do.</p>
			<p>In the morning, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">hotel</term> manager drove us to
				the station. We were very early for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940" type="subject"
				>train</term>, and so I watched the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject">people</term>
				who were there waiting for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940" type="subject">train</term> with us.
				It was simple farm folk, who all looked so good-natured and chatted pleasantly to each other. Maybe, at that moment, I would gladly
				have swapped places with them, I was a bit nervous that we would stand out there, and if a man happened to walk by us twice, I thought
				he might be spying on us. Of course, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940" type="subject"
					>train</term> was delayed, it had certainly been stopped at the border.</p>
			<p>Finally, it came, and we set off with three stops and no notable events or issues to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3343955/bratislava.html">Bratislava</placeName>. There, we gave in our bag and went into the city.
				The city itself is quite beautiful, especially the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/791630/danube-river.html"
					>Danube</placeName>, which is very wide there.</p>
			<p>We arrived at about midday. First, we bought our tickets, actually, we booked them, as we couldn’t pick them up until the afternoon,
				and then we went to go and have <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">lunch</term>. We
				decided to go somewhere nice to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eat</term>, using
				the last of our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">money</term>, as who knew whether we
				would be able to do that again. So, we made our way to the Carlton, the best <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">hotel</term> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3343955/bratislava.html">Bratislava</placeName>. After wondering around for a bit, and asking some
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject">people</term>, we finally got there. It was
				really nice, the company was very mixed, partly good foreign <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207"
					type="subject">people</term>, and partly Nazis. After the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
					type="subject">meal</term>, we went to pick up our tickets, and then we wanted to go and have a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">coffee</term>, we had to use up all our time
				somewhere, so after we had walked around the square twice, backwards and forwards, we went into the first, best <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">café</term>. Of course, it was a Nazi <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">café</term>, which we noticed, to our shock. But we
				stayed there anyway. We were happy to be rid of the Nazis but, there, we had to go into a <term

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">family</term> out, but that it had proved completely
				impossible.</p>
			<p>Then it was five o’clock in the afternoon, which meant we still had a huge amount of time. We definitely had to go and buy some black
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">cloth</term>, as <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz">Smetana</persName> had advised. So we went to the Jewish quarter. It looked terrible there, many of
				the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-889" type="subject">shops</term> were completely locked up, the
				others were half empty and there was not a single <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-889" type="subject"
					>shop</term> that was not damaged. On every single one, there was some kind of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-340" type="subject">anti-Jewish inscription</term>, and some were

			<p>We went inside one of them and the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject">people</term>
				there were so unhappy and depressed and tried to offer us all their wares. After we had got the piece of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">cloth</term>, we went to a <term

				<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077311/czechia.html">Czech</placeName> one, which was decidedly more comfortable. We still
				had about a hundred <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">Koruna</term> left over, which
				we wanted to spent, as we could not take them with us. So we looked around the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-924" type="subject">shops</term> a bit more, but most of them were already
				closed and so we did not buy anything more at all. We went straight to the station and had a larger dinner there, to get rid of some
				more of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">money</term>. Mutzi wanted simply to
				throw the rest of it away, as we did not dare give it to the guard. We bought some cigarettes for Friedl, and a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-683" type="subject">book</term>, then boarded the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940" type="subject">train</term>.</p>
			<p>It was not as empty as we had predicted, there was only one empty <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940"

			<p>And then they left, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940" type="subject">train</term> travelled
				onwards and nothing else happened, I had expected that the officials would come back again, but only the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/719819/hungary.html">Hungarians</placeName> came along, and then we were in <placeName

			<p>What should we do now? We stood by the window, behind the curtains, of course, so nobody could see us, and watched the residents. It
				was a long village road with very little traffic, every now and then a lorry or bicycle went by. Across from us was a small <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">house</term> where it seemed that countless <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207">people</term> lived, as every other blink of the eye
				a different person appeared at the window. So, at least we had a little distraction. By the toilet in our <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">guesthouse</term> there was a small balcony that overlooked a little
				garden, we went out there for some <q>fresh air</q>, because we mostly kept the window in our <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">room</term> closed… today is the 13th, in two days the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3017382/republic-of-france.html">French</placeName>
				<term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146">visa</term> would run out, what then? We couldn’t
				go back anymore. We <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">ate</term>, stood at the window
				again and waited. After <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">tea</term>, we saw the small
				car outside, it was really the cinema-owner, he got out and waved at us, came up, but he had not spoken to <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz">Fritz</persName> yet, he was on his way to see him. It was past 9 o’clock when he knocked on our
				door. <q>Everything is in order,</q> said the Cinema-owner by way of greeting. Then he handed us the <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141">passports</term> and a <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843">letter</term> from <persName ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz"
					>Fritz</persName>, then he wished us luck and said goodbye. Yes, he also said that <persName ref="#ehri_et_smetana_fritz"
					>Fritz</persName> could unfortunately not accompany us to the border, as he had to travel to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3067696/prague.html">Prague</placeName> imminently. He also advised us to ask our host to drive to
				our <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940">train</term> early, so we wouldn’t have to drag
				our case there ourselves, as it was quite a long way away. Then Mutz and I went back to our <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">room</term> and, first of all, read the <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843">letter</term>.</p>

			<p><q>Madams, I have enclosed the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/719819/hungary.html">Hungarian</placeName>
					<term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146">visa</term> and some <term type="subject"
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934">money</term>. Unfortunately, I am no longer able to accompany you
					any further, as I have important things to take care of, but do not worry, everything will go smoothly. I am sending you some 10
						<term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934">Mark</term> notes, take them with you.
					Tomorrow morning you will travel to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3343955/bratislava.html">Bratislava</placeName>,
					unfortunately you will have to spend the day there in some way or another, as your <term type="subject"
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940">train</term> to <placeName
						ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Budapest</placeName> does not depart until after midnight. Get
					second-class tickets and, in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Budapest</placeName>, your friends
					will provide further help. The best way to get the <term type="subject"
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934">money</term> over the border will be to put it in a piece of
					dark-coloured cloth and hide it between the seats in an empty compartment, I do not think you will have any difficulty with this
					as the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940">train</term> will definitely be empty.
					So, do not <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-829">worry</term>, everything will go
					according to plan. You can retrieve the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934"
						>money</term> at the border and exchange it in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html"
						>Budapest</placeName>. I think that is all. Please destroy this <term type="subject"
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843">letter</term> as soon as you have read it.</q></p>

			<p><q>I can’t do this</q>, Mutz said, in despair, <q>he said he would get us safely across the border! I’ll try and get across, but I
					won’t do that thing with the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934">money</term>!</q>
				Obviously, we had both envisioned it all quite differently, he had indeed promised us many times that he would take us over the border
				himself, and now he had just written a <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843">letter</term>
				saying we should <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-192">smuggle</term>
				<term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934">money</term> over the border – what were we paying
				him so much <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934">money</term> for; why had we given him
				such a large <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934">sum</term> the day before? But we had
				to get away from there, at any price, and we could not go back anymore. So, we really did not have a choice.</p>
