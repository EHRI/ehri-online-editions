				<p>Testimony of Ulrich Arnheim, which became a part of the ‚Äúdocumentation campaign‚Äù in Prague. Arnheim was deported from the
					Theresienstadt Ghetto to Auschwitz-Birkenau in the fall of 1944. He describes his shock upon arrival in the camp. After a few
					days, he was allocated to a work transport, which was sent to Gleiwitz for forced labor. Arnheim described the harsh living
					conditions of the inmates, the evacuation of the camp in January 1945, and the death march which followed.</p>

			<p>On <date when="1944-09-28">28.09.1944</date> we were loaded (1st <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-521"
					type="subject">transport</term>) in <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-758" type="camp"
					>Terez√≠n</placeName> and went with the strong opinion, that we were being sent to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1152" type="subject">Germany</term> to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>. When we arrived in <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-437" type="camp">Bautzen</placeName> we became much more unsure about the
				destination. In <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-461" type="camp">G√∂rlitz</placeName> already we
				were all agreed, that we were going to the more or less famous <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-2"
					type="camp">Birkenau</placeName> Ghetto. The only other was out, was that we would end up in the Glatzer coal mines. The hope
				became weaker and weaker, and as we finally arrived in <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-16"
					type="camp">Gleiwitz</placeName> was completely gone.</p>
			<p>We arrived on a large, open train station tracks when suddenly the doors burst violently open and we heard only these words: Everybody
				out, luggage stays in the carriage. The first things that we saw was electrified barbed wire on both sides with electric lamps every 5
				meters. Further away, we saw a chimney, that had a giant red flam coming out of it. It was ‚Äì we would later discover ‚Äì one of the five
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-501" type="subject">furnaces</term>, that <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">worked</term> night and day. We were in the <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-498">annihilation</term> and <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">concentration</term> camp <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-2" type="camp">Auschwitz-Birkenau</placeName>. We had to line up in fives
				alongside the train and were shown to a big, strong <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216"
					>SS</term>-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer who sorted us. (Dr. <persName ref="#ehri_et_schwarz">Schwarz</persName>) The weak, <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">ill</term>, elderly and those younger than 14-16 years
				were led into the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term> on the left. Those of
				us who were left (from the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-521" type="subject">transport</term> of 2500,
				1100 were left) went to <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term> on the
				right.</p>

			<p>Now that we had arrived in the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term>, the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term> told us that this <term type="subject"

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-534">gassed</term> here, but that was nothing to do with us is we were
				willing to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>, and that we would get new
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term>. We were led into the sauna,
				undressed completely, shaved, bathed and got new <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject"
					>clothes</term>. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term> were the
					<term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">German</term>
				<term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669">prison</term> uniform. Then we were led into the
				actual <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term>. This was divided into two <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836">barracks</term> and the <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term> senior ‚Äì a <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">German</term> felon ‚Äì explained the rules of the <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term> to us.</p>
			<p>When this was finished, we were chased out of the block in order to spend the long, beautiful day outside. At 1PM we got our first
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">meal</term>. It was ¬æ of a litre of <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">pumpkin soup</term> that was inedible for a cultivated
				person. But we were <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569">starving</term> and when a
				person is <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569" type="subject">hungry</term>, he will <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">eat</term> everything. This amazing <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">lunch</term> was given to us in dirty bowls, or if you
				were especially lucky, in washing bowls. Altogether, there was about 30 bowls available for 1000 <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483">people</term>. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">meal</term> had to be finished with 30 minutes.
				Spoons, or other such items used by <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483">people</term>
				daily, were a rarity for us and none of us thought about them anymore. And so, we spent the whole day outside, in front of the <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">barrack</term>, until at about 7PM when there was
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">dinner</term>. This consisted of 150g of <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">bread</term>, a spoonful of <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">marmalade</term> and a slice of <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">sausage</term> that could only be seen through a magnifying glass.
				After this extensive evening <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">meal</term>, we were
				chases into the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">barracks</term> in order to sleep.
				However, what one usually understands as sleep and lying down of course didn‚Äôt apply here. Five of us sat on a freezing cold, concrete
				floor and fought over space until one or another fell asleep more or less tired.</p>
			<p>At 4AM we were forced out of these wonderful four-poster beds and the terrible, new and oh so long day would begin. Three times a day
				we had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-487" type="subject">roll call</term> so that nobody could <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204">escape</term> and tell the world how nice, wonderful
				and cultivated life was under the liberators of Europe. It went on <pb n="2" facs="EHRI-ET-JMP016_02.jpg"/> like this for six days,
				until we were finally allocated to a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-521" type="subject">work
					transport</term>. Of course, nobody knew where it was going, the main thing was getting out of this inferno of death and the
				Devil.</p>
			<p>After we got new <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term> and were bathed
				clean, we were brought to a train station ‚Äì envied by those who had to stay behind ‚Äì to be sent to our new <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term>. We travelled for a few hours until we arrived at our
				destination at about 11PM. It turned out that we were in <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-16"
					type="camp">Gleiwitz</placeName>. We were led to a <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term>, given our first <q>good <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">soup</term></q> and sent to bed. At 4AM we were
				awoken and presented for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-487" type="subject">roll call</term>. We heard
				now officially that we were in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-508" type="subject">work camp</term>
				<placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-16" type="camp">Gleiwitz I</placeName>, which belonged to the
					<orgName ref="#ehri_et_reichsbahnausbesserungswerk">RAW (Reich Railway Improvement Works)</orgName>. We wanted to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term> that factory. The <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216">SS</term>
				<term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-508">Camp</term> Commandant <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_moll_otto">Moll</persName> explained to us that we would have it good ‚Äì good <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>, <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>, treatment ‚Äì as long as we were prepared
				to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>. We shouldn‚Äôt be bothered by the wall
				and the electric fence. The very next day we went to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject"
					>work</term> in the factory.</p>
			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> really was a bit better than in
					<placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-2">Birkenau</placeName>. In the morning we got 150g of <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">bread</term>, 20g of <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">margarine</term>; midday we got ¬º litre of <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">soup</term> from <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">beets</term> and water, apart from Sundays when we had <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">potato soup</term>; and evenings again 150g of <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">bread</term> and 50g of <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">salami</term>. But the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term> was for many <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483">people</term> strenuous. It was also very dirty <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>, and on top of all that there was the
				harassment from the master (<term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">German</term>), for
				whom we were just <q>cattle</q>. Add to that the very little sleep that we got at night and the long hours we <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">worked</term> with only half an hour lunch break. A
				normal person who doesn‚Äôt have the strength of horse can‚Äôt endure it. After we got back to the <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-508">camp</term> from <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>, we were tormented by the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term>, <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-485" type="subject">Capos</term> and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-484" type="subject">block seniors</term> until 9PM. And so we lived from
				one day to the next, every second Sunday should be free from 2PM. For us it looked like we had to carry stones from the outside the
				whole morning long. Even the people running the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-508"
					>camp</term> didn‚Äôt know why. It was just harassment. Thank God that time passed and it was soon Christmas. Eight days before we
				were told that if we behave ourselves and there were no complaints from the factory about laziness amongst the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483" type="subject">prisoners</term>, then at Christmas we would get two
				full days off. We would also get better <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
				>food</term>.</p>

			<p>Christmas came and we really did get the first day off. There was also a thick <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">potato soup</term> and cooked <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">potatoes</term>. The second day didn‚Äôt go quite so peacefully. We
				were lying in bed as the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-484" type="subject">camp senior</term> came in
				and all hell broke loose. The place looked like a pigsty. Ten minutes later <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-487" type="subject">roll call</term> was announced and as punishment,
				carrying stones was ordered. We carried stones until 3PM and then we stood at <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-487" type="subject">roll call</term> until 5PM, during which the dirtiest
				were sought out and punished with a beating. At 5.30PM, we finally got our <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">lunch</term> and then immediately afterwards our <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">evening meal</term> and were allowed to go to bed
				completely exhausted and battered. That‚Äôs what the two free days at Christmas looked like for us. But, we were already used to such
				things. What can you expect of such beastly creatures as the <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">Germans</term> were? It was almost New Year. The <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">German</term>
				<term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-508">camp</term> management wanted again to appear human
				and let us have the day off. I think it probably better to say that they wanted to the day off and to do that of course they had to
				give us the day off. The new year began. What troubles would it bring for us? Nobody knew. But look, it began well. Our <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-508">camp</term> commandant <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_moll_otto">Moll</persName>, formerly the head of the <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-499">annihilation chambers</term> in <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-0" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName>, was transferred to <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-3" type="camp">Buna-Monowitz</placeName>, and we got a new one. The first
				impression was promising. He held a speech in which ‚Äì amongst other things ‚Äì he pronounced that under him, there was no <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term> on Sundays, that the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> would be improved and that better care
				would be provided for the many <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483">people</term> who
				were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">ill</term>. We breathed a little easier. In any
				case, he was not like <persName ref="#ehri_et_moll_otto">Moll</persName>, and pretended at least that he had good intentions. How well
				he would deliver them, that remained to be seen.</p>


			<pb n="3" facs="EHRI-ET-JMP016_03.jpg"/>

			<p>And the next Sunday we really did get off. And once there was <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">milk</term>. But none of it lasted very long. On the <date
					when="1945-01-18">18th of January</date>, the shift coming back from the factory told those of us who were <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">ill</term> in bed, that the factory was being dismantled because of
				the advance of the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583">Russians</orgName>. This hit us like a
				bomb. And the question quickly arose of what would be done with us. There were three possibilities: 1 <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-541" type="subject">shoot us</term>, 2 leave us to the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583">Russians</orgName>, 3 <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-623" type="subject">evacuation</term> to the not yet occupied <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1152" type="subject">Germany</term>. There was much commotion in the <term
					type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-508">camp</term>. Nobody new what was going to happen in
				the next hours. Suddenly, at 4PM, we were given our <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-623"
					>evening meal</term> and sent to bed. We were expecting an unexpectedly quick <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject">decampment</term>. And then, at midnight we were woken
				up and told to get ready and at 6AM we started out. Even the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216"
					type="subject">SS guards</term> didn‚Äôt know where we were going. We had about 1.5 kg of <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-623">bread</term> and 1/2 kg of <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-623">margarine</term> that was supposed to be our <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> for three days. We started <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject">marching</term>. We didn‚Äôt have the slightest ideas
				how long we would be <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject">marching</term> for. After we
				had walked six hours through snow and ice without rest, we were told that we still had 37 km to go until we would get our first break.
				We were all <q><distinct type="camp_language">Muselm√§nner</distinct></q> [walking skeletons] and knew that even if any of us were even
				capable of doing it, we would have to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject">march</term>
				into the night.</p>
			<p>Every so often, someone would collapse and then the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject"
					>SS</term> would<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-541" type="subject">shoot</term> them. And so we
				went, on and on to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1152" type="subject">Germany</term>. And then
				suddenly, at about 1AM, there appeared a camp before us. We were forced into the <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term> and more than 1000 <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> were thrust into not very large <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">barracks</term>. It wasn‚Äôt possible to properly lie down, and barely
				possible to stand. People were sitting on each other. It was terrible. In one <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term>, (<placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3095014/kotlarnia.html">Jakobswalde</placeName>), we stayed until 11AM the next day only to begin
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject">marching</term> again. We started <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject">marching</term>, destination unknown. But we noticed
				that something wasn‚Äôt right. Things were going badly behind the front. We <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject">marched</term> at a brisk pace and without a break for
				twelve hours and arrived at <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-7" type="camp">Blechhammer</placeName>
				at 11PM. We were met by Jewish <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-485" type="subject">Capos</term> and
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-484" type="subject">block seniors</term>.They were very friendly to
				us and said that we would continue tomorrow. We slept for the first time in four days in <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">beds</term>. At 4AM we were drummed out of bed for <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-487" type="subject">roll call</term> and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject">departure</term>. We however ‚Äì a few hundred who were
				in one of the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">barracks</term> at the back ‚Äì had
				decided, that we wouldn‚Äôt go until the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term>
				came and collected us themselves. And we did the right thing. 700 <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> had followed the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term> and were now leaving with them. Because the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term> were in a rush and you could already
				here the drone of the front, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term> were
				satisfied with the 700 volunteers and left the rest of us to our punishment from the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583">Russians</orgName>. It wasn‚Äôt a long period of peace. The next
				night, an <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS detachment</term> came and took a
				further 400 <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> who had gone to the gate out
				of curiosity. In the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term>, the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483" type="subject">prisoners</term> were <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569">starving</term> which led to the savage <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532">killings</term> amongst themselves. The <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">bread</term> and provision stores were attacked and anybody who left
				carrying bread was beaten and bludgeoned until unconscious or half dead by those standing outside. Death came when those who emerged
				afterwards stood on the those who had been beaten and defended what they had. In the meantime, an <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS annihilation troop</term> had shown up and divided
				themselves amongst the watchtowers, using the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483"
					>people</term> running around blow as target practice. When they were finished and they were afraid as the front got nearer and
				nearer, they attempted to set the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term> on
				fire, which for all but two of the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">barracks</term>
				they failed to do. Finally, they made themselves scarce. The <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term> was a terrible sight. Every couple of meters there was a
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515" type="subject">dead body</term>, half burnt or bled-out and
				congealed in the cold.</p>
			<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515" type="subject">bodies</term> caused a terrible smell of plague.
				We <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831">lived</term> like that for 2-3 days in the most
				awful fear that we would be <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-541">shot</term> at the last
				minute by the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1152">Germans</term>. Even when there was
				no more <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term> in the <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term>, <pb n="4" facs="EHRI-ET-JMP016_04.jpg"/> we were still
				in the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1152">German</term> area of the front, and
					<orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583">Russians</orgName> weren‚Äôt coming as quickly as we hoped.
				On the fifth day, a brave man who had ventured outside of the <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term> met a <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583">Russian</orgName> tank. The rejoicing was immense, because none of
				us had thought that we would ever get out of the clutches of the <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1152">German</term> beasts.</p>
