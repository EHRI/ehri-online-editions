			<p>On <date when="1941-10-24">October 24, 1941</date>, the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> invaded <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">Kharkiv</placeName>. It is difficult to convey the horror that I was seized by.
				Yet, the desperate situation forced me, a Jewish <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject"
					>child</term>, to stay in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">Kharkiv</placeName>.</p>
			<p>The <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Fascist</term> demonstrated what they were capable of already on the very first day. On

					>Soviet</term> people were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-542" type="subject">hanging</term>. The

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-132" type="subject">victims</term>. The windows were shattered, the rooms
				over-crowded – no place for laying or sitting down. During interrogations, they usually beat up the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598" type="subject">arrestees</term>. They were held for roughly ten days
				and then, already half-dead, <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">shot dead</term>.</p>
			<p>Once, a crowd assembled on the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">yard next to the building of the Area
					Committee</placeName>
				<note place="bottom">געגנטקאָם = Райком (Районный комитет) is a Soviet abbreviation for Area Committee, see Glossary of Soviet
					Military and Related Abbreviations (Washington, D.C.: Department of the Army, 1957), 131.</note> – there was a radio there. I
				passed by to get water. And suddenly we saw how from the highest floor of the building they let down a young <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term> on a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-542" type="subject">rope</term>. At first we did not understand what it
				is. A heartrending cry was heard: <q>Help!</q> The unfortunate remained <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-542" type="subject">hanging from the balcony</term>. The frightened crowd
				dispersed into all directions.</p>
			<p>This was the morning after I had a bad dream, as if my dream gave me a foreboding about the future. <pb n="11"
					facs="EHRI-ET-SOV005_11.jpg"/> They demanded that my <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html"
					>building</placeName> provides 10 Jews to be sent to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556"
					type="subject">work</term>. I was not among them. After the people finished the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>, they were sent to the <q><placeName
						ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">International</placeName></q> as <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-663" type="subject">hostages</term>. I began to wait for my turn.</p>
			<p>On <date when="1941-12-15">December 15</date>, they wanted all Jews of our <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html"
					>building</placeName> as <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-663" type="subject">hostages</term>. I
				decided that I won’t fall into the hands of the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">murderers</term> alive and that I will
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-217" type="subject">commit suicide</term> instead. I did not have
				any poison, but I found a razorblade. Ten times I cut my wrist with the blade, but due to my inexperience I was unable to reach the
				vein. From the loss of blood I lost consciousness. I regained consciousness from a knock at the door. They notified me that today is
					<date when="1941-12-15">December 15, 1941</date>: all Jews are obliged to leave the <placeName

					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">Kharkiv</placeName>. The blood ran from my wound, I hardly understood
				what was going on.</p>
			<p>It is hard to describe the image – 15 thousand people, or even more, walked on <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">Staro-Moskovsky Street</placeName> to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-890" type="subject">tractor factory</term>. Many of them carried things.
				There were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">sick</term> people, even paralysed ones.
				They were carried by others. The path from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">Staro-Moskovsky
					Street</placeName> to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-890" type="subject">tractor factory</term>
				was paved with <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515" type="subject">dead bodies</term> from old people,
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">children</term>, and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">sick</term> people.</p>
			<p>In the evening, we arrived at our new <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">domicile</placeName>. I entered the
				barrack. Instead of windows, there were big holes without window panes. The doors could not be closed. There was nothing to sit on. A
				ice-cold wind was blowing. I was weakened by the blood loss and fainted. I regained consciousness from a cry: a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> with <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child</term> were crying. There were more and more
				people, it was very cramped, and in the darkness someone fell on top of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> with an infant. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">baby</term> cried. When the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject">mother</term> saw that the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child</term> stopped moving, she started screaming:
					<pb n="12" facs="EHRI-ET-SOV005_12.jpg"/>
				<q>Help! This is all that is left to me – my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject"

						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-542" type="subject">hanged</term>.</q> What could we do, though?
				Turning on the lights was prohibited. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject"
					>baby</term> died.</p>
			<p>I ended up in a bad barrack. We were fifty people. Some were lucky – they bought bunk beds. On each bunk, 5–6 <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> were laying. It was bitterly cold. I slept
				on the floor. My hands and feet froze from the cold.</p>
			<p>Another misfortune was waiting for me. I have just one <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822"
					type="subject">sister</term>. A long time ago, 30 years to be exact, she converted to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-763" type="subject">Christianity</term> and in her <term

				if somebody pushed me, and I saw my only dear <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject"
					>sister</term>. Four days, she sat with me in the barrack. There were good people around, who helped her, and she <term

						ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_russians">Russian</term>
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject">passport</term></q> after all and it was easier
				to help her than me. We did not say goodbye properly, so she would not turn around. I only looked at her and wanted to hand over
				everything to her with this one look.</p>
			<p>The wound on my wrist did not close. I was suffering from the cold and from <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569" type="subject">hunger</term>. The <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> would usually let us go to the market or to get water if we gave things in
				return. The <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> continuously <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">killed</term> people. I saw how a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">boy</term> was walking. The <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> yelled to him: <q>Ey, Jude!</q> When the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">boy</term> approached them, a <term

					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">shot him dead</term>. Before the <term

					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">shot</term>, they usually <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">killed</term> around fifty people every day. Once they

					the night, we will <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">shoot</term> everyone.</q>
				But how can you demand from a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">baby</term> not to
				cry? They could not be diapered, they were laying wet in the cold. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject">mothers’</term> milk had dried up from all the

			<p><pb n="13" facs="EHRI-ET-SOV005_13.jpg"/> I managed to change barracks – no. 9. This barrack was lucky: it was the last in line for the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-540" type="subject">massacre</term>.</p>
			<p>The <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> tried to swindle us into going to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-540" type="subject">massacre</term>. In the third week, they announced:
				those, who want to be drafted for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term> in
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/696643/poltava.html">Poltava</placeName>, <placeName

					>Romny</placeName>, should go in front. It was as if a needle stung into my heart and I remembered my bad dream. 800 <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> signed up. I saw how they were put into
				trucks. They were not allowed to take anything. Soon enough, we heard a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">shootout</term>. The next day, they already no longer
				asked who wanted to go. They snapped up <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject"
				>women</term>, tore them away from their <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject"
					>children</term> and threw them into the trucks. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826"
					type="subject">men</term> were chased on foot.</p>
			<p>I gathered the last drop of strength and went into the adjacent barrack. I entered hell: <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515" type="subject">dead people</term>, dishes, down from the pillows,
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term>, <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>, everything mixed up. In one corner, a
				dead <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> lay on a bed with her hand
				dangling, and a small <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child</term> was sucking on
				her dead fingers. In the other corner, a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">dead</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">old man</term> was lying.</p>
			<p>I don’t quite remember how I made it to my barrack. I just really wanted to live. I envied a dog, a cat – they had the right to live,
				nobody hunted them down, and I, simply because I am a Jewish <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824"
					type="subject">child</term>, I have to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject"
					>die</term>.</p>
			<p>Every day from the early morning hours, we sat and waited for our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745"
					type="subject">death</term>. Once, we had a moment of respite. From the direction of <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/692703/staryy-saltiv.html">Saltiv</placeName>, a cannon <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">shootout</term> could be heard. The doomed thought
				that this was our army. They said: <q>They will save us</q> and embraced each other and cried. As it turns out, I have strong nerves
				since I endured.</p>
			<p>Finally, the day next to last arrived. In the evening, a young pregnant <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> was brought into our barrack. When she
				learned that <pb n="14" facs="EHRI-ET-SOV005_14.jpg"/> she will be <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536"
					type="subject">killed</term> tomorrow together with everyone else, she started to be in labor. I could not sleep because of her
				cries. In this very night, I decided to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">run
					away</term>.</p>
			<p>At dawn, I got ready. I put a bedsheet into the pocket of my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836"
					type="subject">coat</term> in order to bandage my wound again and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">went off</term>. At every turn, there were <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo men</orgName> with guns. What to do, where to go? They will
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">kill</term> you either way… There was no time to
				think things through, every second was precious. Right this second, an officer called out to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1097" type="subject">soldiers</term> to sort through the things of the
				Jews which were lying on the truck. I lay down on the ground and crawled towards the ravine. The <term
					ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> turned around. I crawled into the snow and covered myself with the bedsheet. I
				lay like this on the frozen ground in minus forty degrees until the next morning. As soon as it dawned, I started to crawl and reached
				the other side of the ravine, with great effort I crawled all over. It was bitterly cold, and there were not patrols standing beside
				the ravine. My heart was throbbing when I walked through the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/770155/jedrzejow.html"
					>village</placeName>. I was afraid of every look.</p>
			<p>Where should I go? People will surely be afraid to let me in since you get the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">death</term> penalty for it. My closest friends were
				the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">family</term> of <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_redko_kyril_arsentyevitsh">Kyril Arsentyevitsh Redko</persName>. They <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hid</term> Jews risking their lives. They were
				denounced and almost got <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">killed</term>. I knew about
				this and did not want to get them into trouble.</p>
			<p>So where should I go? It is almost nighttime. I won’t be able to get out of the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">city</placeName>. I found a public toilet which consisted of three cabins.
				There, I stayed for three days and four nights. It is difficult to describe the horror. It was terribly cold, the wind blew through
				every crack. I had frost bites all over. I did not have any <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
					type="subject">bread</term>, not a drop of water. Every minute somebody could have found me. On the fourth day, I started to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">freeze to death</term>. Suddenly, I felt warm. I heard
				how I said: <q>Water! <pb n="15" facs="EHRI-ET-SOV005_15.jpg"/> A bit of water!...</q> I don’t know how I made it through to the next
				morning. Exceeding all strengths, I got up from the dirty floor and went out. I went to <persName
					ref="#ehri_et_redko_kyril_arsentyevitsh">Kyril Arsentyevitsh</persName>. I kept falling down. Thankfully, they lived close to the
				location where I had taken <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">refuge</term>. They
				received me warmly. I stayed with them for three days. When I recovered a little, I felt again that I am a human being equal to all
				others. They gave me <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> and with a broken
				heart said goodbye to me.</p>
			<p>My feet did not want to go on anymore. They felt like wooden blocks. I set out in the direction of <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/702417/lyubotyn.html">Lyubotyn</placeName>. It is a horrible thing to be on one’s way without knowing
				where to. Who will take me in? Who needs me?</p>
			<p>With difficulty, I made it to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/544572/korotysh.html">Korotysh</placeName>. I entered several
				cottages, requested to stay for the night, but was turned down. I decided to find a place where nobody would notice me and to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">freeze to death</term> there. But before that I went
				into the last cottage. I was lucky, they let me stay for the night. In the morning, there was a big snowstorm and the mistress of the
				house felt sorry for me and let me stay with them. I stayed with them for three weeks. <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
					>Germans</term> often came to the cottage. They were looking for <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1215" type="subject">partisans</term>, but they miraculously did not find
				me.</p>
			<p>Eventually, I had to leave them as well. I was not able to walk, however. My feet had turned into a black, purulent mass. Before I
				departed, the homeowner’s <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject">mother-in-law</term> said
				to me: <q>Wait.</q> She escorted me to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-287" type="subject"
					>doctor</term> in the cottage laboratory. He examined me and said: <q>Your feet are lost.</q> This felt like a second <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">death</term> sentence. What shall I do in my situation
				without feet?</p>
			<p>I want to relate something about the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-287" type="subject">doctor</term>.
				Unfortunately, I don’t know his <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">family</term> name
				but he was called Petro. He sent me to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject"
					>hospital</term> in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/702417/lyubotyn.html">Lyubotyn</placeName> and used to come to <pb
					n="16" facs="EHRI-ET-SOV005_16.jpg"/> renew my compresses. This was a wonderful <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_soviets"
					>Soviet</term> person. He suspected who I was. When the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286"
					type="subject">nurse</term> whispered something to him while writing down my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">family</term> name, he replied: <q>This is not
					relevant to us. Our responsibility is to help this <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825"
						type="subject">woman</term>.</q></p>
			<p>And so I lay in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/702417/lyubotyn.html">Lyubotyn</placeName>. For me, it was paradise. I lay on a soft bed, nobody
				chased me away. I was given <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> twice a day.
				And even if this was not much, it was at least a warm meal. I remained in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term> like this for six months – from <date
					when="1942-02-07">February 7, 1942</date>, to <date when="1942-07-02">July 2, 1942</date>. I was lucky: when I was <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospitalized</term>, they did not look at my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject">passport</term>. And I did not let go of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject">passport</term> the whole time. I <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hid</term> it in between the mattresses.</p>
			<p>I feel terrible when I think about how they amputated the toes of both my feet and after that cut off the inner bones. After a month, I
				got a fever – 40 degree. I could only lay on my back. I was not able to sleep because of the pain. I only wanted one thing – to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">die</term> in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term>. When the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term> releases me – where will I go? I
				envied every dying person. Then I understood how lucky people are who <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">die</term> a natural <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">death</term>.</p>
			<p>When <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">sick</term> people were brought in from
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">Kharkiv</placeName>, I usually <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hid</term> my face under the blanket and looked out
				with just one eye – what if I see a familiar face? The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286"
					type="subject">staff</term> treated me really well, helped me in any way they could. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">surgeon</term> also gave me a lot of attention. In
				short, it was in this <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term> that I found
				my salvation. Once, a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">sick</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> was brought in from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">Kharkiv</placeName>. She was severely <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">ill</term> and soon <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">died</term>. She was 38 years old. I had just one
				thought on my mind – her <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject">passport</term> could save
				my life. And I got a hold of this very <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject"
					>passport</term>.</p>
			<p><pb n="17" facs="EHRI-ET-SOV005_17.jpg"/> When I was released from the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term>, I stayed with a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">nurse</term> for two weeks. After that time, I went
				on my way. I decided to try and find my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject"
					>sister</term>. I guessed where she might have gone to. The way to get there was not an easy one, though. The wounds on my feet
				had not healed yet and I had to go by foot, <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569" type="subject"
					>hungry</term> on top of it. When I arrived in <placeName ref="#ehri_et_mertshik">Mertshik</placeName>, I felt that I could not go

					>train</term>, but a <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term> asked me whether I have a passage permit. He threw
				me out of the wagon. A <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject">policeman</term> advised me
				to go to the commander to get the passage permit. The commander, however, turned out to be a wild animal, not a human being. He did
				not listen to me to the end and started screaming:<q> To hell! Get out.</q></p>
			<p>I sat at the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940" type="subject">train</term> station until the evening.
				Then I went to the building where <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940" type="subject">train</term>
				workers lived. I met a kind-hearted <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term>
				there. She fed me and let me stay over night. She also helped me obtain a passage permit.</p>
			<p>I could not imagine the happiness I would feel – is it possible that I will see my only, my dearest <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject">sister</term> soon? Maybe these animals <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">killed</term> her? The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940" type="subject">train</term> departed from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">Kharkiv</placeName>. I <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hid</term> in a corner so that nobody catches sight of
				me. At 2pm, I arrived in the shtetl <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/11012866/smorodyne.html">Smorodyne</placeName>. I crossed
				the street and suddenly I understood that I won’t be able to find my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject">sister</term> – after all, I cannot inquire about her
				since this will arouse suspicion.</p>
			<p>Some <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> noticed how lost I was. She asked:
					<q>What is with you?</q> I replied that I was tired and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569"
					type="subject">hungry</term>. She took me to her home. They gave me <term

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">bread</term>. I threw myself on it. I was blushing out
				of shame. I said: <q>Pardon me. I just want to finish one meal, not more.</q> I stayed with them for <pb n="18"
					facs="EHRI-ET-SOV005_18.jpg"/> one and a half months, cooked for them, cleaned the house. This <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> played a big role in my life. It turned
				out that she is an acquaintance of my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject"
				>sister</term>.</p>
			<p>How should I convey to you our reunion? I wanted to throw myself at my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject">sister</term>, to embrace her, to kiss her – I was
				convinced after all that she had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">died</term>, and
				she – that I was long gone. Yet, our conversation was cold. We pretended that we don’t really know each other. We had to have iron
				patience to persevere.</p>
			<p>I stayed in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/11012866/smorodyne.html">Smorodyne</placeName> for one year and three months. I was
				as a chef, a nanny, a beggar and lingered in different corners of the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/11012866/smorodyne.html"
					>city</placeName>.</p>
			<p>I saw how the <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term> barbarians took revenge on the youth. Immediately after
				examining them, they confined them in a special <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/11012866/smorodyne.html">building</placeName>
				and they wouldn’t even allow them to say goodbye to their <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819"
					type="subject">families</term>. Relatives used to run after them, and the bandits used to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">shoot</term> at them in turn. There were many cases in
				which the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">teenagers</term> maimed themselves or
