						<note><p>Founded in 1925</p><p>The Schutzstaffel was a small detachment was formed in 1925 to provide security for Hitler.
								Beginning in 1929, under the tutelage of Heinrich Himmler, the SS was enlarged and became an independent entity
								(1944-07) within the Nazi Party. In 1934, it effectively eliminated its rival, the SA, during the Night of the Long
								Knives. The SS was composed of the Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei, Waffen-SS,and Totenkopfverbaende. All police agencies
								were brought under the control of the SS in 1936. The Nuremberg Tribunal declared the SS to be a criminal organization
								for the ‘persecution and extermination of Jews’, brutality and murder of inmates in concentration camps, excesses in
								their administration of occupied territories, exploitation of slave labor, and mistreatment of POWs.</p></note>

			<p>My Dears</p>
			<p>By now you will have received the airmail <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject"
					>letters</term> we sent from here, from which you will have gathered that we have now arrived safely. As mentioned in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject">letter</term> I had wanted to write to you from the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-129" type="subject">ship</term>, but had not been able to on account
				of a rather stormy crossing. I will now finally do what I had intended and describe to you what happened to us following the crisis in
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/8505031/czechoslovakia.html">Czechoslovakia</placeName>. Of course I can only do this in
				the most general terms otherwise I would have to write a whole novel.</p>
			<p>As you know we moved to X. on <date when="1938-10-10">10th October</date>. The reason for this was that I did not want to stay in Z.
				any longer under any circumstances. As soon as the mobilisation was announced the rumour spread in Z. that if war broke out the Jews
				would all have their throats slit because they were responsible for it in the first place. This was passed on to a number of
				acquaintances by trustworthy people, and some acquaintances had already left Z. in the last few days. We did not do so, however,
				although we did listen to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-850" type="subject">radio</term> day and
				night to see what would happen. Initially I took the whole thing to be nothing more than gossip and assumed that everything had turned
				out for the best because war did not actually break out. However I decided from that point to live only in furnished <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">accommodation</term>, because you are more mobile if
				something happens. So we put our furniture into storage with a removal company and rented two furnished <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">rooms</term>. I spent a lot of time in X. chasing up
				the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1032" type="subject">authorities</term> to make sure that our
				preparations for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-203" type="subject">emigration</term> were progressing.
				However this sort of thing is now much more difficult and protracted than it used to be because you have to sort things out with many
				more <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1110" type="subject">offices</term> than before. We had reserved a
				place on a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-129" type="subject">ship</term> for the <date
					when="1938-12-28">28th December</date> and wanted to travel together with A. However we changed this in the light of what had
				happened.</p>
			<p>Before describing the events of <date when="1938-11-10">10th November</date> (exactly four weeks after our move to X.) I want to
				mention that there was a simple but particularly moving celebration of <foreign xml:lang="he"><term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-754" type="subject">Chanukah</term></foreign> on board the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-129" type="subject">ship</term>. A gentleman who had already been living
				in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/281184/jerusalem.html">Jerusalem</placeName> for five years, and had apparently once been a
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1069" type="subject">newspaper editor</term>, gave a speech, the
				motto of which I would like to adopt as the title for my descriptions, in particular because you, my dear ... and you too, my dear ...
				have written to say that we should forget what happened. Certainly one has to look to the future, but I would like to leave it up to
				your discretion to decide, once you have read what follows, whether it is perhaps right not to forget the things that have occurred,
				but instead make sure that our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">children</term> know
				about them one day too.</p>
			<p>The motto of the gentleman’s speech was as follows: <q>Children of Israel, do not forget what Amalek did to you.</q></p>
			<p>Previously we had only known from <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1134" type="subject">school</term> what
				it was like to experience a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-346" type="subject">pogrom</term> in which
				the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-758">Tempel</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-758" type="subject">[</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-758" type="subject">synagogues</term>] are destroyed, now we know for
				ourselves. On the morning of <date when="1938-11-10">10th November</date> I drove into town to visit the removal company in order to
				sort out various things relating to the containers. I passed a Jewish jewellers and its blinds were down and there was <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-345" type="subject">broken glass</term> on the street. I thought to myself
				that there must have been a burglary because we had not heard anything at <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">home</term>
				<pb n="2" facs="EHRI-ET-WL1375B307_02.jpg"/> about what had happened. En route to the removal company I then saw that the windows of
				the Jewish shops had been <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-345" type="subject">smashed</term> in and that
				some of the merchandise had been <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-345" type="subject">thrown out</term>
				onto the street. In short, I encountered gangs of around 15 to 20 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826"
					type="subject">men</term> armed with axes and pickaxes who were in the process of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-345" type="subject">smashing</term> everything to pieces. When I arrived
				at the removal company the glass rained down from the windows of the <foreign xml:lang="de">Klauß</foreign> (orthodox <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-758" type="subject">synagogue</term>) right next door to the office.
				Inside much had already been <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-356" type="subject">destroyed</term> and
				lots of curious people were looking through the door, which had been <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-345" type="subject">smashed</term> with an axe.</p>
			<p>So these were the first things I experienced that morning on my journey into town. Initially everyone thought that the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-758" type="subject">synagogues</term> and shops would be <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-356" type="subject">destroyed</term> and that that would then be the end
				of the matter. However, as a result I wanted to pay the removal company and buy our tickets for the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-129" type="subject">ship</term> as soon as possible so that we could <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-203" type="subject">leave</term> suddenly if necessary. I telephoned ...
				in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2759794/amsterdam.html">Amsterdam</placeName> because we had heard that it was not easy to
				get <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject">permission</term> to gain entry there. For this
				reason I changed the booking to the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2750405/kingdom-of-the-netherlands.html"
					>Holland</placeName> Line, because that would mean going to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2747891/rotterdam.html"
					>Rotterdam</placeName> to board the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-129" type="subject">ship</term>.
				If we used the American Line it was possible that the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2750405/kingdom-of-the-netherlands.html"
					>Dutch</placeName> would tell us that we had to board in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2911298/hamburg.html"
					>Hamburg</placeName>.</p>
			<p>Jewish <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-931" type="subject">bank accounts</term> were being kept under
				particularly strict surveillance by this point. Gaining access to our money in Z. was only possible after a number of telephone calls
				and after I had also got the removal company to make a call. Despite this, the payment for the container had to be approved by the
					<foreign xml:lang="de"><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName></foreign> and the
					<foreign xml:lang="de"><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-1361">Kreisleitung</orgName></foreign>
				[Nazi municipal authorities]. At the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-930" type="subject">banks</term>
				you also could not have unlimited access to your money and often had to collect a series of small amounts. A decree was also issued by
				the <foreign xml:lang="de"><orgName ref="#ehri_et_bankenvereinigung_berlin">Bankenvereinigung</orgName></foreign> [banking
				association] in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2950159/berlin.html">Berlin</placeName> to the effect that to prevent a sharp
				fall in prices Jews could not sell their stocks and bonds. One could only sell stocks and bonds up to a maximum of RM. 1,000.- if the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-931" type="subject">account</term> was not in credit. For this
				reason I spent the credit in my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-931" type="subject">account</term> so
				that I could sell RM. 1,000.- worth of securities. One had to make an effort to wade through all these things because it was often the
				case that by midday instructions that had been in place in the morning had suddenly changed.</p>
			<p>From the removal company I went <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">home</term> and
				reported what had happened in the city. I then went to get <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
					type="subject">food</term> for the people in our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
					>house</term> because we could no longer <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
					>eat</term> at the Jewish <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">restaurant</term>
				following its <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-345" type="subject">wrecking</term>. En route I visited a
				good friend as he had telephoned <foreign xml:lang="de">Mutter</foreign> [Mother] to say that I should not go into the city. Whilst I
				was there a man joined us and reported that the gangs were now going around private <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">homes</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-345" type="subject">smashing</term> everything to pieces and that the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> were going to be <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598" type="subject">arrested</term>. Immediately I then returned <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">home</term> to <foreign xml:lang="de">Mutter</foreign>
				and prepared her and the other people in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
					>house</term> for a possible visit from these people. As I stood guard behind the curtains one of these gangs did indeed come down
				our street, however passed us by and turned round the corner. We then saw <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-683" type="subject">books</term>, cushions, <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term>, household goods etc. flying out of the
				windows onto the street three <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">houses</term> down
				from our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">home</term>. It was essential to act in
				these minutes. <foreign xml:lang="de">Mutter</foreign> kept saying I should not stay at <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">home</term>. I therefore spent some time driving here
				and there around X. and saw that the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-356" type="subject"
					>destruction</term> was fully underway in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
					>homes</term>. I parked the car next to others on the roadside because I did not feel safe in the car any longer.</p>
			<p>Now walking around on foot with my briefcase containing the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141"
					type="subject">passports</term>and the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject"
					>visas</term> for the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/6252001/united-states.html">USA</placeName>, I had to show utmost
				self-control and not run away if I came across one of these gangs. There <pb n="3" facs="EHRI-ET-WL1375B307_03.jpg"/> was nothing for
				it however but to keep up with the onlookers and then disappear into thin air. Although I stayed close to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">home</term> I did not feel comfortable knowing that
				Mama was alone there with the old people. I telephoned Mama and we met in town as it had all pretty much come to an end there and the
				gangs were all now in the residential areas. Mama came over immediately with a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">sausage</term> and a piece of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">bread</term> for everyone for <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">lunch</term>. We drove past the furniture store and
				saw that nothing had happened there. (I later heard that that they had wanted to destroy everything there too, but the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-373" type="subject">Aryan</term> removal man had been able to prevent them
				from doing so.) We then decided to travel to Z. because we could not tell whether what had happened in X. was merely the result of
				local decision making. In any case <foreign xml:lang="de">Mutter</foreign> had a <term type="subject"
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-287">doctor</term>'s appointment in Z. that day because he wanted to
				change the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-280" type="subject">bandage</term> on her injured hand. We
				telephoned Z. and discovered that B. had been <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598" type="subject"
					>arrested</term>. We did not know, however, that they were intending to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598" type="subject">arrest</term> all the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term>, because his deputy was on the phone. We
				ate the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> that Mama had brought along in
				the car en route. In Z. I rang acquaintances and was told that the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826"
					type="subject">men</term> had been taken away there as well, and that the same thing had happened to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">homes</term>. We decided to travel to Y. next and then
				possibly from there visit the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-287">doctor</term> in X. In
				Y. we were told by ... that all of the Jews had to be out of the city by evening. ... had not been taken and while we were there a
					<foreign xml:lang="de"><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-428">Schupo</orgName></foreign> [<term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1091" type="subject">uniformed</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1120" type="subject">policeman</term>] turned up to demand a signature
				confirming that he would leave the city by the evening. We then drove to <foreign xml:lang="de">Onkel</foreign> [uncle] C. who was
				packing, and in the evening went over to ... . (In the meantime he has made it to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/4990729/detroit.html">Detroit</placeName> with <foreign xml:lang="de">Tante</foreign> [aunt].) We
				took C. and D. with us to X. to join their acquaintances. In the evening when we arrived in X. we telephoned our landlord and were
				told that nothing had happened in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">flat</term>
				there. So the day was finally over and we returned <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
					>home</term>. One heard that everything had died down in the afternoon, yet one was not confident that someone would not still
				turn up and collect those who had been forgotten. Occasionally one could not sleep, one could not eat on account of the agitation, or
				one slept soundly and could also eat due to the agitation.</p>
			<p>Now one really could see misery everywhere. People kept arriving in X. from ... and other towns because the Jews had been expelled from
				the ... Gau. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-314" type="subject">old people's home</term> in ... was
				burned out so the old people moved to the Jewish <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-314" type="subject">old
					people's home</term> and to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-280" type="subject">hospital</term>
				in ... . Mattresses, bed linen etc. were quickly collected and the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837"
					type="subject">home</term>, which had not been affected, was nothing less than a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-321" type="subject">refugee camp</term>, and so overcrowded that the
				mattresses had to be laid out on the floor for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-304" type="subject"
					>refugees</term>. Anyone who had acquaintances elsewhere tried to reach them in order to have somewhere to sleep and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eat</term>. People kept turning up at our place too
				until they could finally get to their acquaintances. The people arrived with a small suitcase or a bundle - just as in the pictures
				one has seen of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-304" type="subject">refugees</term> in <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1348" type="subject">wartime</term>. It will doubtless interest you to
				know about what happened in ... and we got to hear quite a bit because people were arriving all the time. It was bad because many
				people did not know where their relatives or acquaintances had ended up. Everything happened in such a rush that initially everyone
				had to see to their own affairs and then one would meet someone by chance who would be able to say where the others were. We heard the
				following about ... from acquaintances who came from ... .</p>
			<p>In the morning the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-758" type="subject">synagogue</term> was already in

					facs="EHRI-ET-WL1375B307_04.jpg"/> and we visited Papa's <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-748"

					>confiscated</term>, apart from some small change, so that they were virtually penniless when they arrived. The people were happy

			<p>It was impossible to get a clear picture of everything that had happened, and of course in all the excitement all kinds of rumours did

			<p>We were in ... for one night because I did not have any time during the day, and was out and about sorting out our <term

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-345" type="subject">wrecked</term> any of the <term

			<p>On the street in ... I met ... from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2759794/amsterdam.html">Amsterdam</placeName> and he came
				round to me at midday. I explained to him that we have a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146"
					type="subject">visa</term> for the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/6252001/united-states.html">USA</placeName> and want to
				go to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2750405/kingdom-of-the-netherlands.html">Holland</placeName>. He immediately wrote me an

					type="subject">imprisoned</term> there until he received a summons from the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1118" type="subject">consulate</term>. However he was not badly off there
				and was happy not to have ended up in a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject"
					>concentration camp</term>.</p>
			<p>Now I want to stop describing all these wonderful things because I could go on for page after page and there is no point. From these
				lines you can get an impression of what these fine people we have been living with are like. I am sure there are also perfectly decent
				people there, yet it is a fact that something of this kind has happened in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germany</placeName>
				<pb n="6" facs="EHRI-ET-WL1375B307_06.jpg"/> in the 20th century.</p>
			<p>You will now doubtless understand why I began by quoting the motto of the speaker at the <foreign xml:lang="he"><term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-754" type="subject">Chanukah</term></foreign> celebration, and just
				want to mention once again that these occurrences should remain in the memory not only of this generation but also the next, and that
				no Jew should ever forget something of this kind.</p>
			<p><q>Children of Israel, do not forget what Amalek did to you.</q></p>
			<p>However now I just want to mention briefly all the things that at the time had to be sorted out for <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-203" type="subject">emigration</term>. I am not doing this just so that I
				can tell you all the things I had to do, but rather so that you will understand if and when you ask yourselves whether this or that
				could not have been sorted out first.</p>
			<p>As you know we were summoned to the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1118">consulate</term>
				on <date when="1938-08-09">9th August</date> thanks to the surety stood for us by ... . Because a formality had to be sorted out with
				the surety we only received our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject">visas</term> on
					<date when="1938-09-12">12th September</date>. It goes without saying that at the time I immediately delivered the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject">letter</term> to the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3469034/federative-republic-of-brazil.html">Brazilian</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1118" type="subject">consulate</term> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2925533/frankfurt-am-main.html">Frankfurt</placeName>. At the time the secretary in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1118" type="subject">consulate</term> told me it could take three months
				and Mama should be grateful if she got a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject"
					>visa</term> at all as there was only one <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843" type="subject"
					>letter</term> of recommendation. As I have already told you, Mama did get her <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject">visa</term> so it is not necessary to write about
				that all over again.</p>
			<p>I also applied to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-203" type="subject">emigrate</term> to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3439705/oriental-republic-of-uruguay.html">Uruguay</placeName>. To this end I handed over RM. 1,000.-
				for both of us. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject">visa</term> was to be issued in
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2911297/free-and-hanseatic-city-of-hamburg.html">Hamburg</placeName> and the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1118" type="subject">consul</term> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2925533/frankfurt-am-main.html">Frankfurt</placeName> told me I should pack everything and then
				travel to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2911297/free-and-hanseatic-city-of-hamburg.html">Hamburg</placeName>. There I would
				receive the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject">visa</term> once the formalities had
				been taken care of. Yet during this period there was the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-930"
					type="subject">business</term> with <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3865483/argentine-republic.html">Argentina</placeName>
				where people prepared everything and were then banned from going, so they did not get their <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject">visa</term> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2911297/free-and-hanseatic-city-of-hamburg.html">Hamburg</placeName>, they had given up their <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">homes</term> and had no <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject">visas</term>.</p>
			<p>For this reason the whole thing with <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3439705/oriental-republic-of-uruguay.html"
					>Uruguay</placeName> seemed to me to be too risky because I could not get the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject">visa</term> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2925533/frankfurt-am-main.html">Frankfurt</placeName> before everything was packed. This is all
				sorted now and I have taken the paperwork with me in case it comes in useful at some point.</p>
			<p>So at this critical point Mama had her <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject">visa</term>
				for the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/6252001/united-states.html">USA</placeName> and so did I. We had to go to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2925533/frankfurt-am-main.html">Frankfurt</placeName> a number of times until Mama got the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3469034/federative-republic-of-brazil.html">Brazilian</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject">visa</term>. E.g. we were in <placeName

					xml:lang="de">Aktion</foreign> [operation], as they called the whole thing, was supposed to have died down. The <placeName

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1118" type="subject">consul</term> advised me to go to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2911297/free-and-hanseatic-city-of-hamburg.html">Hamburg</placeName> immediately and leave on the
				next <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-129" type="subject">ship</term> because they were still going to
				round up more people in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2925533/frankfurt-am-main.html">Frankfurt</placeName>. Not
				surprisingly it was a major struggle to keep one's head during this period. There were long queues of Jews at the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1118" type="subject">consulates</term> and the offices of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-926" type="subject">shipping lines</term> and the faces of these
				beleaguered people were a terrible sight to behold.</p>
			<p>You now know all about the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1146" type="subject">visa</term> question.
				Then the containers had to be sorted out, because we were fortunate in that our furniture had not been smashed to pieces. Because we

						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-005233">Devisenstelle</orgName></foreign> would not allow me to take

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-931" type="subject">accounts</term> check. And then there was usually the
					<foreign xml:lang="de">Zollfahndung</foreign> [customs <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1135"
					type="subject">investigation</term>], which checked every last detail with a fine toothcomb.</p>
			<p>So I made photocopies of all the <foreign xml:lang="de">Unbedenklichkeitsscheine</foreign> that I had, then had them witnessed by a
				notary and used these documents instead. I frequently had to go to the <foreign xml:lang="de"><orgName
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-005233">Devisenstelle</orgName></foreign> in ... and then received
				permission for Mama to pack, though in my case there were still some questions to be answered. Following various visits to the
					<foreign xml:lang="de"><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-005233">Devisenstelle</orgName></foreign>
				the official told me they did not recognise me. On the basis of the <foreign xml:lang="de">Unbedenklichkeitsschein</foreign> I was
				able to ensure that I could pack as well. However when he then informed me that the outstanding question had not been answered I
				thought again that I might be <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598" type="subject">arrested</term>.</p>
			<p>Two days after receiving the <foreign xml:lang="de">Packgenehmigung</foreign> [packing permit] we filled both of the containers and the
				suitcases and had everything sent to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2747891/rotterdam.html">Rotterdam</placeName>. Through a
				notary I had already made sure that ... had been sent power of attorney over everything and arranged that I would write to him from
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2750405/kingdom-of-the-netherlands.html">Holland</placeName>. He would then sort out the
					<foreign xml:lang="de">Reichsfluchtsteuer</foreign> and the 20% Kontribution with the <foreign xml:lang="de"><term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1153" type="subject">Finanzamt</term></foreign>. I am now waiting for
				a reply to find out whether he has done so. I wrote to him from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2750405/kingdom-of-the-netherlands.html">Holland</placeName> once the containers had arrived in
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2747891/rotterdam.html">Rotterdam</placeName> so that they did not get held up for any
				reason. We could not <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-219" type="subject">transfer</term> anything under
				these circumstances and I was told that for the time being no <foreign xml:lang="de"><term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">Sperrmark</term></foreign> [blocked Marks] were
				being sold. However in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2750405/kingdom-of-the-netherlands.html">Holland</placeName> I heard
				that it is possible after all, and will see what remains after the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1047"
					type="subject">taxes</term> have been paid and how it can be <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-219"
					type="subject">transferred</term>.</p>
			<p>We spent a week in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2750405/kingdom-of-the-netherlands.html">Holland</placeName> and boarded
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-129" type="subject">ship</term> in <placeName
