			<p>Before the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1080" type="subject">war</term>, I lived with my husband and

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1134" type="subject">studied</term> to be a tailor. I was actually a

					ref="http://www.geonames.org/294640/state-of-israel.html">Israel</placeName>. In order to do this, I needed a practical <term

				against it. They were not <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-907" type="subject">Zionists</term>. They were

				what I would describe as <q><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-726" type="subject">good</term></q> Jews. I,
				thus, visited a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1134" type="subject">technical college</term> and

			<p>A day before the outbreak of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1080" type="subject">war</term>, we left
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3094802/krakow.html">Krakow</placeName> to resettle in <placeName

			<p>During the first two years of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1080" type="subject">war</term>,

				do so <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-234" type="subject">illegally</term>. They were classified as

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1141" type="subject">passports</term> and nothing more.</p>
			<p>When I now think about it, what we later experienced and suffered at the hands of the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germans</placeName>, I can only say that it was not clear

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hide</term> in this shop. We could not think of a
				better <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-265" type="subject">hiding place</term>. The owner did not want
				me to bring my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">children</term> with me and, as we
				did not believe that anything would happen to my husband and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824"
					type="subject">children</term>, it was agreed that I would move into the shop and that, each morning before going to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>, my husband would give my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> to my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> in the shop on my behalf. He would
				then collect her in the evening.</p>
			<p>At the time, I spent the whole day at the keyhole of the locked shop door and observed what went on in the street. I saw how my husband
				went to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> every morning with our <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">son</term>, and saw them return in the evening. I also
				saw the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName> and the leading away of the Jews.</p>
			<p>On the afternoon of the <date when="1942-08-05">5th of August</date>, it was the fifth day of the <q><term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-550" type="subject">operation</term></q>, one of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">womens</term>’ brothers came, who had <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hidden</term> me and said <q>It’s terrible today!
					Today, they’re taking the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject"
				>children</term>!</q></p>
			<p>I got a terrible shock and begged her brother to get a message to my husband from me that he should <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hide</term> our <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">children</term>, but it was already too late!</p>
			<p>From the keyhole, I could only see what happened directly in front of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">house</term>. And, upon hearing the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName> and seeing them pass by, I did not know that they
				had gone into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">house</term> next-door. We could
				hear how a member of the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">SS</orgName> asked the Landlady for the
				key to the shop. The landlady did not have the key, but a neighbour said that she had one and went to get it. The <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">SS</orgName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term> put it into the lock of the door leading
				to our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-265" type="subject">hiding place</term>, but the lock did not
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> properly. We all stood paralysed
				with <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-829" type="subject">fear</term>. He shook the door and pulled the
				bell cord up and down, but the door did not open. One kick with his <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836"
					type="subject">boot</term> would have sufficed to kick it in, but this did not happen. The <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">SS</orgName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term> turned around and left without having
				opened the door.</p>
			<p>We were all still as if possessed. I heard a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">little
					girl</term> say loudly to the Landlady outside the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837"
					type="subject">house</term> next-door <q>They took Herr <persName ref="#ehri_et_stern">Stern</persName> and little <persName
						ref="#ehri_et_stern_uri">Uri</persName> from our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837"
						type="subject">house</term>!</q> And, as the landlady was hard of hearing, she repeated the sentence once more even
				louder.</p>
			<p>It was in this way that I learnt that they had taken my husband and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824"
					type="subject">child</term>.</p>
			<pb n="5" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560540_05.jpg"/>
			<p>I never heard from them again. When it was dark, I wanted to go onto the street to look for them. The Jewish shopkeeper was very
				friendly. The sister-in-law and niece fainted after the affair with the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">SS</orgName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term> at the door. They are now all <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">dead</term>. I spent 14 days wandering the streets at
				the time and tried to find out anything I could, but it was in vain.</p>
			<p>My parents were still alive. They were, along with 120 others, in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262"
					type="subject">hiding</term> in an attic. At this time, the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germans</placeName> had <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">killed</term> 40,000 Jews. Later, a <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> was opened. All Jews had to go there
					<q>voluntarily</q>. It was a very small and cramped <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562"
					type="camp">ghetto</placeName>. We lived 8 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject"
					>people</term> to a formerly very small <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
					>commercial premises</term>. I had my parents with me there, who only there learned of the disappearance of my husband and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">son</term>.</p>
			<p>We all had to live inside the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName>
				and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> outside it. About six weeks after
				the <q><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-550" type="subject">operation</term></q> I found <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> as a tailor for two secretaries from the
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">German</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">Housing Office</term>. The first secretary was
				called <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Irmgard Wieth</persName>. She was about 30 years
				old and came from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2973783/strasbourg.html">Strasbourg</placeName> where her father was a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-842" type="subject">teacher</term> at the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1134" type="subject">grammar school</term>. She was very enthusiastic to
				have found a good tailor and spoke to me often. She also enquired as to what had happened to my husband and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child</term>, whereupon she said <q>Why did you not
						<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hide</term> the <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child</term>?</q> At the time, I said to myself
				that she had to be a kind-hearted person, who sympathised and thought that I would possibly turn to her in an emergency.</p>
			<p>Like all <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">German</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1111" type="subject">civil servants</term>, Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> was very good at general management. She lived
				in a very nice <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">one-bedroom apartment</term> with a
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term> and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">bath</term>. She was supplied with considerable
				quantities of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term> in particular. These were <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term> which had been taken from Jews. It was
				these <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term> which I had to alter for
				her.</p>
			<p>In <date when="1942-11">November 1942</date>, a second <q><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-550"
						type="subject">operation</term></q> began. In the very first night, I coincidentally did not find myself in the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName>, but my parents and my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> were there. I had spent the whole day
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">working</term> at a <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/798544/republic-of-poland.html">Polish</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">lady’s</term>. It was late and I said I wanted to
				go. She said that I had better stay the night there. Jews were not allowed on the streets at night, so I stayed. Very early, it was
				still dark, my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> came. She had <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">run away</term> from the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName>, so I took my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> with me in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">Housing Office</term>. During the night and the
				following day, many Jews were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598" type="subject">arrested</term>, who
				were not <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">employed</term> in the <foreign
					xml:lang="de"><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">Wehrmacht</orgName></foreign> and, as I turned
				up at the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">Housing Office</term>, I was told <q>We
					are no longer allowed to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">employ</term>
				you!</q></p>
			<p>Most of the Jews, who had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">worked</term> at the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">Housing Office</term>, did not go, only a very few,
				who knew nothing of the matter, like me,</p>
			<pb n="6" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560540_06.jpg"/>
			<p>went to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> at the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">Housing Office</term> that morning.</p>
			<p>I was totally helpless. It was quite clear to me, if I returned to the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> now with my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term>, we would be <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">killed</term>. And, as I saw no other way out, I crept
				to Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> and asked her if I could not, at
				least, give her my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> for a few days.
				Her first reaction was great surprise. <q>How can I do that?</q> She asked me. <q>I know that you are alone in your <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term>!</q> I said that I knew why she
				hesitated; she was uncertain, as only <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html"
					>Germans</placeName> lived in the block. Finally, she explained that she would have to think about it.</p>
			<p>For the whole day, I sat in the corridor of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
					>Housing Office</term> and waited. Some Jews were needed for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1051"
					type="subject">black market</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>. Now and again, Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> appeared in order to see if I was still there.
				The other Jews, who were sitting there, asked me what I was going to do. I was scared to say anything to them. I could not say
				anything to them. Somehow, I had the feeling that Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223"
					>Wieth</persName> would help me in the end, but nobody should know this.</p>
			<p>Around about evening, Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> appeared again
				in the corridor and collected me. <q>I must speak with my colleague</q> she said. <q>Please wait!</q> The colleague, the second
				secretary, with whom she was close friends, and for whom I had also altered <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term>, as well as for a male supervisor.
				After quite a long time, she appeared once more and said to me <q>It’s OK!</q> Take your <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">armband</term> off (with the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">yellow star of David</term>) and throw it away. Then,
				walk slowly and calmly along the street towards the tram stop. My friend and the Town Councillor will go before you and I will
				follow.</p>
			<p>It was in this manner that we walked through the whole town and were brought into Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth’s</persName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term>. She only had <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">potatoes</term> to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eat</term> in her <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term>, as she almost always <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">ate</term> in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">canteen</term> at <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>. This was all the same to us. We were
				happy with the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">potatoes</term>.</p>
			<p>I stayed at Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth’s</persName> for two weeks with my
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term>. I made enquiries as to whether
				the <q><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-550" type="subject">operation</term></q> was over yet. I was very
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-829" type="subject">fearful</term> for my parents. I did not know
				whether they were still alive. It was only after two weeks that Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> let me go. I had to go into the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> to find my parents. They were both
				alive, but they both believed that my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject"
					>daughter</term> and I were no longer alive. I returned to Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth’s</persName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term> and explained to her that I
				absolutely had to return to the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp"
				>ghetto</placeName>. I could not leave my parents alone there.</p>
			<p>In the meantime, new <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">armbands</term> had been
				distributed to the Jews, with the insignia of the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438"><foreign
						xml:lang="de">Wehrmacht</foreign></orgName>. Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223"
					>Wieth</persName> knew a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1428" type="subject">Jewish Doctor</term>
				and she asked where she could get an <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">armband</term>
				for me. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1428" type="subject">Jewish Doctor</term> was very surprised
				when he heard that Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> had kept a Jew
				in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hiding</term> and he asked her to take a relative
				of his. He offered her a great deal of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">money</term>
				for this.</p>
			<pb n="7" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560540_07.jpg"/>
			<p>Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> came and told us that she was
				utterly disgusted. <q>I’m not doing it for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject"
						>money</term>!</q> she explained. <q>If I have you and your <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824"
						type="subject">child</term> at my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
						>home</term>, I have a clear conscience…, but for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934"
						type="subject">money</term>? No way!</q></p>
			<p>Again and again she protested when I told her I must return to the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> to my parents. <q>Alright!</q> she
				said one day. <q>Go, if you have to! But <persName ref="#ehri_et_stern_abraham_lilith">Lilith</persName> (that was my <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term>) is staying with me! That’s a
					shame for the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName>. They’ll <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">shoot</term> you one day and then I’ll adopt
						<persName ref="#ehri_et_stern_abraham_lilith">Lilith</persName>!</q></p>
			<p>I then got my new <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">armband</term> with her help, went
				back into the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> and my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> remained with her. Despite the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">armband</term>, my position was very complicated.
				Possession of an <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">armband</term> ought to prove that
				the wearer had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> with the <foreign
					xml:lang="de"><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">Wehrmacht</orgName></foreign>, but I had no
				such <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>. I had, first of all, to acquire it
				illegally. This, I did as soon as I had succeeded in getting back into the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> and some <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929" type="subject">factory</term>. The Director of this <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929" type="subject">factory</term> was very understanding towards Jews and
				was very good to them. I was even allowed to take my father into the <term

				He was 63 years old; I said he was 55 and therefore he was allowed to come to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> with me in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929" type="subject">factory</term>. Every morning, we always left the
					<placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> with a group of 35 Jews, in
				order to go to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929" type="subject">factory</term>. The groups, who
				went to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>, were always led by a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-691" type="subject">band</term> of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-691" type="subject">musicians</term> composed of Jews, who had to play
				pleasing <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-691" type="subject">melodies</term>. It was always the same
				torment for me each morning and I had the feeling that I was losing ever more nerves each morning. But, this was, of course, the
				intention of the Nazis. They were quite systematically driving us all mad! They wanted to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-555" type="subject">ruin our nerves</term>.</p>
			<p>From the groups of those going to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>, there
				were, daily, hundreds brought out and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject"
					>murdered</term>. You never knew, when leaving the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562"
					type="camp">ghetto</placeName>, whether you would return alive. It was in this way that countless Jews disappeared into
				nothingness. In <date when="1943-03">March 1943</date>, they took my father from me at the entrance of the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> and I never saw him again.</p>
			<p>Every Saturday evening, I furtively joined a group of Jews who were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943"
					type="subject">working</term> during the night. In the darkness of the street, I discreetly took off my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">armband</term> and crept away through the whole town
				to Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName>. Then, during the following
				Sunday, I altered her <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term>, for it was
				only in this way that I could thank her for what she had done for my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term>. For some reason, Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> loved my needlework and, as her only interest
				was <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term>, the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> never came to an end. One of her <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">rooms</term> was full of cupboards filled with <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term>. This is how I spent Sundays’ with her
				and every Monday, at 3.30am I crept from Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223"
					>Wieth's</persName>, through the town and back into the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562"
					type="camp">ghetto</placeName> in such a way that I joined a group of Jews unobserved returning from <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">working</term> through the night.</p>
			<p>In the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName>, <pb n="8"
					facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560540_08.jpg"/> I turned around and went with another group who were going to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> through the day in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929" type="subject">factory</term>, outside of the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName>. The whole thing was, naturally, very
				dangerous and Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> said to me again and
				again that I would definitely be caught by the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName>
				one day. The streets were full of <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html"
					>Germans</placeName>, <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/690791/ukraine.html">Ukrainians</placeName> and <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/798544/republic-of-poland.html">Poles</placeName>, who might recognise me. Even if I was
				inconspicuous, anyone could see that I looked very rough and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569"
					type="subject">hungry</term>, as all Jews looked in comparison to other <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject">people</term> on the streets. This is how I spent
				every weekend from <date when="1942-12">December 1942</date> until the end of <date when="1943-05">May 1943</date> without anything
				ever happening to me.</p>
			<p>On the <date when="1943-05-31">31st of May</date>, it was proclaimed <q>The <term

			<p>The owner of our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929" type="subject">factory</term> tried once more to
				help all of the Jews who had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">worked</term> for him,
				so that we did not need to go into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">camp</term>.
				He <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1073" type="subject">negotiated</term> with the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName> and explained that our 35 strong group of Jews
				could live in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929" type="subject">factory</term>. He promised the
					<orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName> that he would have a particularly good
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">leather overcoat</term> illegally finished for
				each one of them and the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName> agreed.</p>
			<p>However, after they had received their <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject"
					>overcoats</term>, they insisted that the Jews would have to leave the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929" type="subject">factory</term> for the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">camp</term>.</p>
			<p>As I left the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName>, in order to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-575" type="subject">resettle</term> in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929" type="subject">factory</term>, I was not allowed to take my mother
				with me. She had had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-493" type="subject">typhus</term> and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">pneumonia</term> and was very weak, but had <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-561" type="subject">survived</term> both. I, thus, <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-266" type="subject">smuggled</term> her out of the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> into the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929" type="subject">factory</term>. And now we were supposed to go into
				the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">camp</term> and the Director was ordered to
				hasten all of us into this <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">camp</term>.</p>
			<p>I did not know what to do! I knew that if I <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject"
					>hid</term>, I could probably save myself by getting to Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> during the night, but this would mean that I
				would have to leave my mother to go into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject"
					>concentration camp</term> alone, and I could not bring myself to do that. To take her with me to Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> was impossible. It was also too far and she
				was too weak. I spoke to the Director of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929" type="subject"
					>factory</term> and begged him to help us in any way he could. I was in the Director’s office during this conversation and my
				mother was in one of the rooms of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929" type="subject"
				>factory</term>. She must have felt what was going on inside me. I suddenly heard a large noise and disquiet in the square. <q>Your
					mother has <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-217" type="subject">fallen out of the window</term>!</q>
				At first, I did not catch on at all and continued to talk to the Director, until someone came up to me again and called me. This time,
				I understood. I raced down the staircase into the square. I found my mother in a sea of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">blood</term>; one <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">eye was missing</term> and the crown of her <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">skull was broken</term>, but she was fully
				conscious.</p>
			<pb n="9" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560540_09.jpg"/>
			<p>I called like mad for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-280" type="subject">medics</term>. I had
				totally forgotten in my excitement that Jews had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-339" type="subject">no
					right</term> to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-280" type="subject">medical assistance</term>. I
				phoned them and asked them to come immediately. As time passed and no-one arrived, I ran in order to ask why no-one was coming. I was
				then told that the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-280" type="subject">medics</term> had turned up, but
				had left again upon being told the matter concerned a Jew.</p>
			<p>In the meantime, the Director had readied a car in which his group of Jews would be conveyed to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">concentration camp</term>. Upon my request, he had a
				stretcher brought upon which my mother was laid. The Director then ordered that we be brought to the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName>..., to the <placeName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-491" type="subject">hospital</term> and be dropped off there. Then, the
				remaining passengers would be taken to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject"
					>camp</term>. This event saved my life.</p>
			<p>I knew that the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> was to be <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-551" type="subject">burned down</term> the following day and I knew that
				my mother, like everyone else, had an even greater <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-829" type="subject"
					>fear</term> of the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp">ghetto</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-491" type="subject">hospital</term>, as it was very brutal there and
				that those patients to be treated, who could not be saved, were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532"
					type="subject">thrown out of the window</term>.</p>
			<p>So, I sat in the car next to my mother, who was still fully conscious, and yet <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">blood</term> nevertheless streamed incessantly from
				her wounds. <q>I must take you to the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp"
						>ghetto</placeName>
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-491" type="subject">hospital</term>!</q> I said to her. <q>Are you
					afraid?</q> To which she replied <q>I’m not afraid!</q></p>
			<p>I was fully aware of the fact that my mother had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-217" type="subject"
					>attempted to kill herself</term>, in order to free me, so that I was free to go to my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child</term> and try to save us both.</p>
			<p>Upon arriving in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-491" type="subject">hospital</term>, we carried my
				mother in and placed the stretcher in the bathroom. All those Jews who had been in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-491" type="subject">hospital</term> were about to leave. They all asked me
				if I was crazy to have come back with my mother. Within the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-491"
					type="subject">hospital</term>, I found a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1428" type="subject"
					>doctor</term> and no patients. They had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject"
					>murdered</term> them all in the last few days. Some attempted to lift my mother out of the continually streaming <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">blood</term>. I asked the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1428" type="subject">Doctor</term> to help her. He said that he had no
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-285" type="subject">medication</term> or anything else. I,
				nevertheless, asked him again and again. Jews ran in and out of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496"
					type="subject">camp</term>. I, once again, looked in the room where my mother lay. She said <q>Go with God! I am now with
				God!</q></p>
			<p>I shut the door and looked once again for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1428" type="subject"
					>Doctor</term>. I still had 200 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-934" type="subject">Zloty</term>
				which I had hidden on my person. This, I gave to him. <q>Here! Take this <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1428" type="subject">Doctor</term>!</q> and I asked him one last time
				to give my mother something..., something which worked quickly.</p>
			<pb n="10" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560540_10.jpg"/>
			<p>Finally, he promised! Whether he actually did it..., I’ll never know!</p>
			<p>Then, I ran down and out of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-491" type="subject">hospital</term> and
				joined a group of Jews leaving the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-562" type="camp"
					>ghetto</placeName> for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">concentration
					camp</term>. I ran like an automaton beside them. I ran totally possessed and desparately. I did not think for a minute about
				taking off my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">armband</term> and to try to get to my
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child</term>. Through pure coincidence, the
				whole time I ran next to a young relative of mine..., a cousin. She spoke incessantly to me, but I did not listen at all and ran on.
				But she did not give up. Again and again she said to me..., <q>Go away! You must go to your <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child</term>! Run! Quickly! Go!</q> Again, I did
				not react and my cousin spoke on <q>You must go! Quickly! Otherwise it’s too late!</q></p>
			<p>I cannot explain it, how it suddenly happened and as I quite suddenly had the impulse to carefully take off my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">armband</term> and allow it to disappear into my
				pocket as we got quite close to the gates of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject"
					>camp</term>. Just as automatically, I slipped away from the group, which carried on. <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/798544/republic-of-poland.html">Poles</placeName> and <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/690791/ukraine.html">Ukrainians</placeName> were standing at the gates of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">camp</term> and looked on transfixed at how the Jews
				went <q>voluntarily</q> and without any supervision whatsoever into the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">camp</term> and to their <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">deaths</term>.</p>
			<p>I also do not know how I arrived totally unharmed into the block and Frau <persName

				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term>. A few weeks earlier, Frau
					<persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> had taken a Jewish couple in and as
				I now arrived and asked her to remain, four <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject"
					>people</term> were there, who she was <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject"
					>hiding</term>. This was in <date when="1943-06">June 1943</date>.</p>
			<p>The situation was very complicated for Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223"
					>Wieth</persName>, as it was for us. It was horrifying for us to consider what Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> was risking in order to save us. We also had
				to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eat</term>, but we did not want to burden Frau
					<persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> at all with such matters, so I
				disguised myself as a country peasant, barefoot and crept out of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">house</term> to get something to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eat</term>. It was only a little, as everything came
				from the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1051" type="subject">black market</term>, as we had no other
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>. Only <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germans</placeName> lived in the block, who naturally, knew
				that Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">worked</term> all day in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">Housing Office</term> and that her <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term> was empty all day. We scarcely dare
				not appear. A period of time thus passed, during which we and Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> became ever more nervous.</p>
			<p>Then, one day, Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> suddenly received a
				telegram from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2759794/amsterdam.html">Amsterdam</placeName> from an old friend of hers, who
				informed her that he had two weeks leave and was coming to visit. Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> was totally beside herself and explained that
				we would have to make ourselves scarce. <q>Good!</q> I said. I saw her terrifying <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-829" type="subject">fear</term> and wanted, initially, to calm her. <pb
					n="11" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560540_11.jpg"/>
				<q>I will try to find somewhere for us!</q> It was, however, totally impossible for me.</p>
			<p>The married Jewish couple, the husband of whom was a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1428" type="subject"
					>Pharmacist</term>, had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-291" type="subject">zyankali</term>. He
				suggested that we share the poison, so that we could all poison ourselves. I told Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> that she should not worry, that we would leave
				her <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term> and find somewhere to commit
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-217" type="subject">suicide</term>. Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> protested vehemently. <q>You don’t know where

			<p>We gathered together and made a plan. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">dining
					room</term> next to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term> was
				emptied and, from now on, we always locked ourselves in when Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> had visitors. Beforehand, we stayed in the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term>, where nobody went. Moreover, it
				was decided that during the visit of Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223"
					>Wieth's</persName> friend from <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
				>Amsterdam</term>, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1428" type="subject">Pharmacist</term> and my
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> would be locked in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">dining room</term>. His wife would openly pose as Frau
					<persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth's</persName> cook, who also lived with her and
				I would pose a her Tailor, who would <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> for
				her during the day and go home in the evening. I had to act as if I was leaving. These roles we then both played. The cook lived
				officially at Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> and slept in the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term>. It was in this way that her
				friend could not go into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term> in the
				evening. Every evening I would loudly say <q>Adieu!</q>; Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> would accompany me to the door of her <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term> and whilst she opened and closed the
				door loudly and acted as though she was still talking to me, I crept back to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term> on tiptoes. All four of us slept in the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term> on the floor, that is, in reality
				we did not sleep much. We constantly worried about one another, that one of us would make some kind of suspicious noise, talk whilst
				sleeping or even snore and so we all took care of each other.</p>
			<p>During the day, Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> always went to <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">Housing Office</term> and the friend stayed at the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term>. He continually went into the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term> to talk to us. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1428" type="subject">Pharmacist</term> and my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> sat on the floor of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">dining room</term>. I placed a large table in front of
				the door to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">dining room</term> and spread my
				sewing out there. I did not speak much and when I did speak, I did so only a very little and in bad <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">German</placeName>. I always acted as though I did not
				understand what her friend said. He talked for hours on end and gave us long lectures about the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1080" type="subject">war</term> and the increasing <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/6269131/england.html">English</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1105" type="subject">air raids</term>.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, I left the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term> and acted as
				though I had something to do in one of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
					>rooms</term>…, then I called him to help me with some hastily made-up chore, in order, in this way, to get him out of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term>.</p>
			<p>As we all spoke to each other in whispers, Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223"
					>Wieth</persName> became acquainted with this when she was at <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837"
					type="subject">home</term>. Her friend picked up upon this. He could not understand and would, therefore, ask her about it, or he
				would come out to me</p>
			<pb n="12" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560540_12.jpg"/>
			<p>in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term> to ask me whether I could
				understand why Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> whispered so
				strangely and why she was so terribly nervous. I always said I could not understand and gave all sorts of reasons in my broken
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">German</placeName>. Two weeks finally came to an
				end and he went back to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2759794/amsterdam.html">Amsterdam</placeName> and we were all alone
				once more.</p>
			<p>A new problem surfaced when Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> was
				supposed to go on <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-752" type="subject">holiday</term> for two weeks to
				her mother’s. This time, she had to leave us all alone in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837"
					type="subject">flat</term>. She had no other option but to lock us in for the whole time she was away. We could not even so much
				as move as the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term> was, of course,
				officially empty. My <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> wasn’t allowed
				to sneeze; we weren’t able to pull the chain on the toilet…, but, this time, everything went well and when Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> returned from <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-752" type="subject">holiday</term>, all was well.</p>
			<p>Yet, Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> became less calm and ever more
				nervous. We did what we could to calm her down, but there was really nothing we could do as we were, of course, the reason for her
				disquiet. We became accustomed to reading her every wish from her eyes and we behaved like slaves to serve her and to be helpful to
				her. In the meantime, she had formed a relationship with a <foreign xml:lang="de"><orgName
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438">Wehrmacht</orgName></foreign>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-886" type="subject">officer</term>, who often visited her. He would
				always stay in the front <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">room</term> and never went
				into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term>.</p>
			<p>For some inexplicable reason, her friend in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2759794/amsterdam.html">Amsterdam</placeName>
				learned of her friendship with the <foreign xml:lang="de"><orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-438"
						>Wehrmacht</orgName></foreign>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-886" type="subject">officer</term> and he, thus, appeared one day from
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2759794/amsterdam.html">Amsterdam</placeName> out of sheer jealousy without announcing his
				arrival beforehand. He kicked up such a fuss at the front door that we all reeled in shock, as we all believed it was the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName>. All four of us hastily disappeared into the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term>, which we locked behind us. Frau
					<persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> went slowly to the door in order to
				give us time to disappear. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">man</term> stormed in
				and began charging around like a wild animal, but not in search of us as we had thought, but after the supposed rival. He shook the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">kitchen</term> door and even looked through the
				keyhole in order to see whether his rival had, perhaps, hid himself there, but did not see us. He posed a terrible sight, but Frau
					<persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> finally succeeded in calming him
				down. He had, of course, found no-one, so he went away.</p>
			<p>This time, not only were we more dead than alive when we were alone once more, Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> was beside herself. It became ever more
				complicated for us to calm her down. Every time someone knocked on the door she believed it was the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName>; she no longer wanted to open the door and it
				became ever more difficult <pb n="13" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560540_13.jpg"/> to persuade her not to lose her head.</p>
			<p>Her friend from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2759794/amsterdam.html">Amsterdam</placeName> did not allow any peace. He got
				in contact with Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> friend in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">Housing Office</term>, the second Secretary, for whom
				I had sewn in the beginning and for whose part was asked for advice about Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> along with the Town Councillor, whether they
				should have taken on my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> and I and
				then, finally, whether they had helped my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject"
					>daughter</term> and I get into Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223"
					>Wieth's</persName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term>.</p>
			<p>Both Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth's</persName> colleague and her friend
				advised him, among other things, that Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223"
					>Wieth</persName> had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">accommodated</term> my
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child</term> and I. He then turned up again one
				day totally surprisingly and barely after the door had opened, beginning to strike out and growled <q>I know everything! You’ve been
					keeping a Jew and her <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child</term> in here in
						<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hiding</term>! You’ll leave your <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">job</term> in the <orgName
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-681">general government</orgName> in eight days otherwise I’ll report
					you!</q></p>
			<p>Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> began to cry and eventually
				convinced him to go with her into a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">room</term> and
				not remain in the corridor, where all the other occupants could hear what he was saying. The argument then continued for hours, whilst
				we crouched down with <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-829" type="subject">fear</term> in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">dining room</term>. He, then, eventually went
				away.</p>
			<p>From now on…, from <date when="1944-03">March 1944</date>, all four of us lived almost exclusively in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">dining room</term>. Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> then received orders to leave <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/702550/lviv.html">Lemberg</placeName>. The <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germans</placeName> dissolved the administration of the
					<orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-681">general government</orgName> before the arrival of the
				approaching <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/8354411/union-of-soviet-socialist-republics.html">Russians</placeName> and Frau
					<persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> was to travel with the remaining
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1111" type="subject">civil servants</term> back to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germany</placeName>. Now, for all four of us, it became
				essential to find a new <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-265" type="subject">hiding place</term>.</p>
			<p>The Jewish couple, who were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hidden</term> with us,
				had contacts in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-773" type="subject">Greek-Orthodox</term> community,
				that is, the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/690791/ukraine.html">Ukrainian</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convent</term> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/702550/lviv.html">Lemberg</placeName> and with the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject">Metropolite</term>
				<persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4017786">Szepticki</persName>, who had already kept around 60 Jews
				in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hiding</term> with him or in other <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convents</term>. This involved the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">families</term> of <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-735" type="subject">Rabbis</term>’ in particular. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1428" type="subject">Pharmacist</term> knew these <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject">people</term> and his <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">son</term> was in <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hiding</term> there. He and his wife now turned to
					<persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4017786">Szepticki</persName> asking for help. Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> insisted that she would tell the entire truth
				to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject">Metropolite</term>. She would make it clear
				to him that they were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hidden</term> at Frau
					<persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth's</persName> with my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> and me and that she would really ask
				him to take all four of us. In the beginning she asked, later, she insisted. I knew from the very beginning that this would be very
				difficult. In order to be taken into a <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/690791/ukraine.html">Ukrainian</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convent</term> you had to have very good contacts
				and references. The married couple had such with the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject"
					>Metropolite</term> and with other diverse <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject"
					>convents</term>, who were subordinate to them. They not only had references, but also <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1137" type="subject">documents</term>. I, however, had neither one nor the
				other.</p>
			<pb n="14" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560540_14.jpg"/>
			<p>In response to this, I told the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1428" type="subject">Pharmacist</term>
				that he should, in the first instance, do everything possible to save his wife and himself. I did not believe for a second that he
				would do the slightest thing for me. I asked him only at the very end that, should he be successful in finding <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">shelter</term> for him and his wife, to put in a word
				for my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> and me.</p>
			<p>Despite his contacts at the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convent</term>, the
				couple had the greatest difficult being accepted and their discussions went back and forth for weeks. I had no idea what would become
				of me and my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child</term> and it was very bad, as
				Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> had, initially, to pack her things.
				At the time, I just thought constantly how lucky it was that we had the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-291" type="subject">zyankali</term>. Then, a miracle happened! The couple
				had finally succeeded in persuading the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject"
					>Metropolite</term> to take us in. And, exactly 24 hours before they had to leave our <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">house</term>, a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject">nun</term> in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convent</term>, where the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> was to be taken in, agreed to take in my
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> and me. Of course, she insisted
				that we would have to move into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convent</term>
				within 24 hours. This was difficult for me, as I had promised Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> I would remain with her until her departure
				and help her. There was, thus, no option for me other than to take my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child</term> to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convent</term> for 11 o’clock the next day. Once
				there, I explained to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject">nun</term> why I had to
				return to Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> and then returned to her
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term>. I helped her pack and took her
				to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940" type="subject">train</term>; then I went to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convent</term> as well.</p>
			<p>I could, of course, not speak <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/690791/ukraine.html">Ukrainian</placeName>, yet they were very
				good to us. My <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> went into an <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-316" type="subject">orphanage</term> annexed to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convent</term>. And, again, I was lucky that I could
				sew. I was immediately given a sewing machine and a pile of sewing. It was in this way that I sewed for the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-327" type="subject">orphans</term> until the end of the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1080" type="subject">war</term>. We were <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">fed</term> well and amply and actually began to
				recover somewhat physically.</p>
			<p>A fairly long while passed until I began to notice that the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731"
					type="subject">nun</term> was becoming rather a little less frien</p>
			<p>dly with me than at the beginning. Finally, one day, a Jewish <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825"
					type="subject">woman</term> said to me, who was also <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262"
					type="subject">hiding</term> in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject"
					>convent</term>, rather as if in passing, <q>the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject"
						>nun</term> no longer wants you here, because you won’t be <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-740"
						type="subject">baptised</term>!</q>I was absolutely horrified, as I had not given it any thought at all. It was then explained
				to me that those supervising the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convent</term>
				always expected such things without having to speak of it. Although I was anything but that which could be described as a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-724" type="subject">pious</term> Jew, I stuck to my beliefs and the
				thought of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-740" type="subject">baptism</term> to me was horrifying. At
				that time, I could not sleep for many nights until I decided to have my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> and myself <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-740" type="subject">baptised</term>. But, the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject">nun’s</term> stance became ever more unpleasant and so
				I went to her one day and explained that I would like to have my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824"
					type="subject">daughter</term> and I <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-740" type="subject"
					>baptised</term>. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject">nun</term> immediately
				became filled with interest</p>
			<p>and changed her <pb n="15" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560540_15.jpg"/> stance in an instant. A <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject">priest</term> was assigned the task of instructing my
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> and I. My <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> was immensely pleased. She found
				everything great and was completely happy and content. And, with that, I had no way out, if I wanted to save my life and my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">child’s</term> life. One night, I dreamt of my father.
				In my dream, I asked him what I should do. He replied very calmly <q>Just do it! It is the right thing to do! There is, of course,
					only one <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-724" type="subject">God</term>!</q> Afterwards, it was much
				easier for me. One day, news arrived from Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223"
					>Wieth</persName>. She was back in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/702550/lviv.html">Lemberg</placeName> and wanted all
				four of us to go back to her. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject">nun</term> quite
				energetically denounced the idea. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject"
					>Pharmacist’s</term> wife, whom she did not like very much, she wanted to leave, but neither my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> nor I could go. So, we stayed in the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convent</term>.</p>
			<p>During the preparations for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-740" type="subject">baptism</term>, we
				had to attend mass every Sunday and the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-773" type="subject"
					>church</term> was located in the district in which we had earlier lived when my husband and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">son</term> were still alive. I was always afraid when
				I was going to and from the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-773" type="subject">church</term> that
				someone would recognise me. I was well <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject"
					>dressed</term> again and looked well-kept and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
					>nourished</term> once more. It was easy to recognise me again.</p>
			<p>Many <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject">people</term>, who previously knew me, went to
				this <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-773" type="subject">church</term> and followed me from the service
				to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convent</term>. I immediately reported it to
				the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject">nun</term> and was immediately resettled into
				the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-316" type="subject">orphanage</term>.</p>
			<p>At the same time, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject">nun</term> explained to the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">Pharmacist’s</term> wife that it would be better
				if she returned to Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName>, as she could no
				longer keep her at the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-728" type="subject">convent</term>. There was
				nothing else for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> to do but to go.
				I, however, was sent, first of all, to ask Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223"
					>Wieth</persName> for the key to her <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
					>apartment</term>. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">Pharmacist’s</term> wife
				later remained in Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth's</persName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">apartment</term> and, after Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> was ordered back to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germany</placeName>, quite a few <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germans</placeName> vacated this block and <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/702550/lviv.html">Lemberg</placeName>.</p>
			<p>When the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/8354411/union-of-soviet-socialist-republics.html">Russians</placeName> came, they
				behaved exactly as they had in the beginning…, thoroughly correctly. No-one harassed us; we could come and go as we pleased. This
				time, we really had the feeling that they were angels who had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-573"
					type="subject">liberated</term> us.</p>
			<p>At my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-740" type="subject">baptism</term>, I was given the name Maria.</p>
			<p>Sometime after the end of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1080" type="subject">war</term>, I was able
				to send my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/6269131/england.html">England</placeName> through an <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-309" type="subject">international aid organisation</term>.</p>
			<p>I <pb n="16" facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560540_16.jpg"/> then gave her the task of immediately trying to get in contact with Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName>. I had the address of her parents in
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germany</placeName> and really wanted to know
				whether she was alive and how she was. My <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject"
					>daughter</term> succeeded in contacting Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223"
					>Wieth</persName>. She was alive, but was obviously not doing too well. When I arrived in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/6269131/england.html">England</placeName> a year after my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term>, I tried to acquire <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term> and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term> for Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName>. This was made possible with the help of an
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/6252001/united-states.html">American</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-303" type="subject">aid organisation</term>, which declared itself in
				the case. We began to become interested in Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223"
					>Wieth</persName> and, initially, began one day to visit us in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/6269131/england.html"
					>England</placeName>. It was very exciting to see her again. At the time, she explained that she no longer wanted to remain in
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germany</placeName> and with the assistance of
				the same <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/6252001/united-states.html">American</placeName>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-303" type="subject">aid organisation</term>, I was actually able to make
				it possible, that she went to the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/6252001/united-states.html">USA</placeName>. There, she
				found <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">employment</term> and remained there. She no
				longer wishes to return to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2921044/federal-republic-of-germany.html">Germany</placeName>. She
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">works</term> for a Jewish <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">family</term>, whose <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">household</term> she manages. Her love for my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> hasn’t changed. When my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">daughter</term> got married two years ago and
				resettled in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/5128581/new-york-city.html">New York</placeName> with her <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/6269131/england.html">English</placeName> husband, Frau <persName
					ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> was ready to help both of them. I, myself,
				married my current husband one and a half years ago and had to remain in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/6269131/england.html"
					>England</placeName>. Frau <persName ref="http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?itemId=4018223">Wieth</persName> intends
