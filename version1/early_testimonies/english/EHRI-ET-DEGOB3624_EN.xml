						<note><p>(1935) 1939-1945</p><p>Arrow Cross Party was the most popular right-wing extremist movement in Hungary before and
								during WWII. The party was founded in 1935 under the name of Party of National Will. Its leader, former officer of the
								General Staff, Ferenc Szálasi was imprisoned (1938-1940) and his party dissolved several times, however, managed to
								return to political life. In the last pre-war elections in 1939 the Arrow Cross gained 29 seats, making it the second
								largest party in Parliament. The party was re-named to Arrow Cross Party-Hungarist Movement in 1942. After Regent
								Miklós Horthy’s attempt to extricate from war on October 15, 1944, the Arrow Cross Party assumed power with Nazi
								support. From October 16, 1944, until March 28, 1945, Ferenc Szálasi was prime minister of Hungary as well as its
								plenipotentiary head of state, bearing the title “Leader of the Nation.” Paramilitary forces of the Party, known as
								Party Service (pártszolgálat) and Armed National Service (fegyveres nemzetszolgálat) committed several atrocities and
								war crimes during their short reign, which claimed the lives of thousands of people, mostly Jews and Roma. Following
								the war, Szálasi and several other Arrow Cross leaders were sentenced to death and executed.</p></note>

			<p><pb n="1" facs="EHRI-ET-DEGOB3624_01.jpg"/> The person in question has given us the following information:</p>
			<p>I passed the days of the siege in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-870" type="subject">Weiss Alice
					Hospital</term>. The <date when="1945-01-02">2nd of January, 1945</date>, an <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-474">Arrow Cross</orgName> group entered the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-870" type="subject">hospital</term>, as they said <q>to control <term
						type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_protection_documents">Schutzpasses</term></q>. Naturally, they did not find them acceptable, and
				they continued with the <q>identity check</q>. They gathered us in a room and selected and separated 36 of us. There was no one older
				than 70 in this selected group, while there were some severely <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292"
					type="subject">sick</term> people among them, like someone with advanced <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">cancer</term>. I asked for permission to go up to my
				room for my stuff, but they let me go only with an escort.</p>
			<p>As I later learnt, it was 3 am when we departed among <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1105"
					type="subject">falling bombs</term> and shells with the alleged reason to get our identity checked. They took us to the building
				of the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-474">Arrow Cross</orgName> in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Pozsonyi Road</placeName>. First, they led us into a completely dark room, and
				later led us into another room, and on the pretext of checking our identity the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-474">Arrow Cross</orgName>
				<q>committee</q>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">seized</term> all our belongings. They <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">took</term> my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">coat</term>, my <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">gloves</term>, turned out my pockets, took off also
				the two <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">blouses</term> I had on to search it and
				check whether I had not hidden anything or sewed something valuable in them. At the end, they even <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">seized</term> my handkerchief. Having <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">searched</term> us they sent everyone into the lobby,
				and when we were all there, they <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">rechecked</term>
				whether we did not leave anything behind, any <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
					>food</term> in the searching room. Naturally, they collected what they still found there. Now, they led us back into the room
				where we were the first time. There were already some <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
					type="subject">people</term> here when our group of 36 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
					type="subject">people</term> arrived; at the end there might have been 40-42 of us altogether. Everyone tried to find some good
				posture. The guards of the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-474">Arrow Cross</orgName> made sure we
				did not talk to each other. We did not get anything to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
					type="subject">eat</term>, if someone asked for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
					>water</term>, they conceded to give it.</p>
			<p>I have to note that we had lived so isolated from everything in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-870"
					type="subject">Weiss Alice Hospital</term> that we had not heard about the already frequent cases when they shot people into the
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/791630/danube-river.html">Danube</placeName>. I did not suspect anything like that, and
				believed we were going to be put into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545" type="subject"
					>ghetto</term> after they had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject">robbed</term>
				us.</p>
			<p>In the morning, someone asked what would happen to us, where they would bring us. They answered we were going to be taken to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Buda</placeName> to do some <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>. All day long we sat there gloomy and
				exhausted, while during the night we had to start off lined up in pairs. <pb n="2" facs="EHRI-ET-DEGOB3624_02.jpg"/> It was a light
				night with an open sky and we could clearly see the fights. We were terribly cold, as we were badly <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">dressed</term> and had no <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">coats</term>. We were walking along the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/791630/danube-river.html">Danube</placeName> towards the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Parliament</placeName>. It was horrible what we saw: all the way along the
				bank of the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/791630/danube-river.html">Danube</placeName><term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515" type="subject">dead bodies</term> and horses were lying around. We
				arrived close to the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Chain Bridge</placeName>, where they wanted to
				lead us down the stairs next to the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Parliament</placeName>. My partner
				commented: <q>Look, they want to do something evil.</q> Since the stairs were already <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1105" type="subject">bombed</term> and we could not go down to the bank
				the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-474">Arrow Cross</orgName> leader told us we would go now to
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Buda</placeName>. And so we did: We crossed the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/791630/danube-river.html">Danube</placeName> on the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Chain Bridge</placeName>. On the other bank we started to head towards
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Margit Bridge</placeName>. We were led to the lower quay. <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">Women</term> went ahead, and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> – around eight of them – followed behind.
				Suddenly, the leader said that <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> should
				stay behind and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">women</term> should proceed. Next,
				we heard more <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">shots</term> from close. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> at my side commented again: <q>Look,
					these have been <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">shot</term>!</q> I still did not
				want to believe they could be so evil, and said it could not happen that so many people got <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">shot</term> and you could not hear a voice. I still
				did not know what it meant if someone was <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject"
					>shot</term> in the back of the neck from very close. The two leading <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-474">Arrow Cross</orgName> men returned to us but without the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> and we still carried on a little while.
				Suddenly, they told us we should turn backwards. Now, I became convinced that the only thing they could aim at was <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">destroying us</term>. If they had had another goal in
				mind we would have continued our walk. I cannot say I was scared but rather I felt surprised, and I could not imagine that everything
				would finish. The others were silent, too. They ordered us to stay one by one facing the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/791630/danube-river.html">Danube</placeName>. It occurred only to a fifteen-year-old <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">girl</term> next to me, who was together with her
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject">mother</term> and <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject">aunt</term>, to start crying for help in her high
				childish voice. They started to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">shoot</term> them
				one after the other. I did not know what to do; I instinctively threw myself on the floor. I do not know how this idea came to my
				mind, now, I cannot account for it; maybe I wanted to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745"
					type="subject">die</term> like this. The poor <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject"
					>woman</term> next to me, who was brought into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-870"
					type="subject">hospital</term> after a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-217" type="subject">suicide
					attempt</term> and wanted to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">die</term> by
				force, started now crying after the first <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject"
					>shot</term> that she was still alive. I heard the voice of one of the <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-474">Arrow Cross</orgName> men as he asked who was shouting, then he <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">shot</term> at her again. I decided not to move:
				either they would <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">shoot</term> me and everything
				would be over in seconds or I would hold out. They checked whether I was still moving and I heard them to comment: <q>This is <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">dead</term> already.</q> They did not <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">shoot</term> me not even in a second round, while they
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">sent another bullet</term> in my neighbour.
				There was moonlight, and the water carried all sounds well, so I clearly heard and saw everything. I knew that they would now drop the
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515" type="subject">corpses</term> into the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/791630/danube-river.html">Danube</placeName>, and I decided to simulate I was <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">dead</term>. I saw with an eye that they began to drag
				the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515" type="subject">bodies</term> towards the water, and I felt when
				an <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-474">Arrow Cross</orgName> man grabbed my legs and pulled me away.
				I have to note that the bank of <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/791630/danube-river.html">Danube</placeName> is a steep and
				high wall here; there are no stairs at this part. I felt being pulled towards the wall and my upper body fell down and he let my legs
				fall, too. <pb n="3" facs="EHRI-ET-DEGOB3624_03.jpg"/> Once again I had luck, because the distance got shorter with the length of my
				body, so I fell less. I felt as I started falling and the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-474">Arrow
					Cross</orgName> man let my legs go but I did not fall into water but on a one and a half metres wide solid strip between the wall
				and water. The only thing I cared about was to remain motionless. I fell on my face and did not even feel when I was hit, I saw only
				later that I fell on soft sand. I remained still in that position. Water was shallow here, and did not take away immediately the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515" type="subject">corpses</term> of my unfortunate companions. I heard
				as they said above me: <q>Water will take them away.</q> I heard this comment perfectly clearly, and studied everything precisely.
				Voices got further and further away; they left. I cautiously raised my head and looked up, when I heard a voice from behind: <q>Don’t
					move, because they are still here!</q> My companion could see up on the wall. I am not sure how much I may have been waiting
				there: a half an hour or two hours. I calculated that they must have been already off, and tried to rise cautiously. I did not know
				what happened to me, whether I was alive and could stand up. I was uncertain about my situation and started to touch the parts of my
				body. I could stand up, nothing happened to me, only my nose was a little bit bleeding. It got injured when I fell on my face but it
				was only a minor graze. I looked around and tried to orient myself. I felt like dreaming. The <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> started to talk again: <q>I am the <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject">sister</term> of the caretaker and if you remain
					alive and can call for help, call the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject"
						>police</term> or the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">ambulance.</term></q>
				I knew it was in vain, as the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">ambulance</term> did
				not function in these times. I began screaming as loud as possible: <q>Help, <term

					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515" type="subject">corpses</term> lay all around. <orgName
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583">Russian</orgName> shells were flying from <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Pest to Buda</placeName>. I tried to help that poor agonising <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term>, I pulled her a little bit towards the
				bank, she was awfully heavy, and I did not know what to do with her. I tried to find out who the people were whom the bandits had
				shot. I found another breathing <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">woman</term> and I
				pulled her out, too. I started thinking, and understood that I should not stay there but ought to get away as soon as possible. Far
				away I saw a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1076" type="subject">military</term> landing stage with a
				bridge to the bank, and I decided to reach it at any price. I waded into water in the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">overshoes</term> I still had on and tried to reach the
				bridge. The water was deep and I failed. Now, however, the instinct for survival did start working in me and I wanted to remain alive
				at any price. I went back to the end of the sandy strip, but not to the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515" type="subject">corpses</term> but a little bit further away. I sat
				down on the ground and waited. Soon, around 7-8 <term type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term>
				<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1076" type="subject">soldiers</term> walked down the bridge and jumped
				into a wide <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1076" type="subject">military</term> boat and started to row
				exactly in my direction by chance. Their leader noticed me and said: <q><foreign xml:lang="de">Da ist jemand</foreign></q>. Soon they
				reached the shore in front of me. They must have thought I had fallen off the wall, and their leader even asked: <q><foreign
						xml:lang="de">Hat Wehgetan?</foreign></q> I promptly understood the situation and responded: <q>Yes</q>. They jumped out, and
				climbed on the wall, one standing on the other. I asked whether they could also help me up. The leader responded laughingly: <pb n="4"
					facs="EHRI-ET-DEGOB3624_04.jpg"/>
				<q><foreign xml:lang="de">Denken sie nicht, dass Sie sind einbischen schwach?</foreign></q> I asked whether they could find an
				ambulance but he answered: <q><foreign xml:lang="de"> Nein, da sind schon die <orgName
							ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583">Russen</orgName></foreign></q>. However, he offered to put
				me in the boat and bring me to the bank, as it was going to be 7 am soon when <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">people</term> could stay in the street. I saw that he
				noticed I was surprised at what he had said since I had no idea that 7 am was the time when already civilians could go in the street.
				They encouraged me that I would surely find a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject"
					>policeman</term> even if I would not be able to call the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282"
					type="subject">ambulance</term>. They lifted me in the boat, covered me with a blanket and landed at the <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1076" type="subject">military</term> bridge; their leader accompanied me
				to the bank and put a cover on me. In fact, I did not feel bad but I tried to pretend I felt really bad. After a few steps, it came to
				my mind that I should thank them for their favour and also wanted to give back the blanket but their leader urged me to take it with
				me. I started off but now I had a great problem: I did not know where to go and what to do. First, I thought I would go and see a
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-763" type="subject">Christian</term> friend of mine living in
					<placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Buda</placeName>, but I did not want to make her troubles and
				anyway my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject">mother</term> remained in <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-870" type="subject">Weiss Alice Hospital</term>, so I decided to go back
				to her whatever the cost. I had no idea how one could cross the bridge without getting his or her identity checked. I walked on the
				lower quay where I did not meet anyone. However, I needed to climb up when I reached the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Chain Bridge</placeName>. There were only <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1076" type="subject">soldiers</term> walking here, and no one cared about
				me, I was not at all a curious phenomenon, they must have thought I was rushing towards an <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1105" type="subject">air raid</term> shelter. I found myself in front of a
					<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1105" type="subject">guard</term> of three members on the bridge,
				and before they could have asked anything I asked whether there was a first aid station on the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Pest</placeName> bank of the river as I had been injured. By chance I was
				lucky again because a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1105" type="subject">soldier</term> with a more
				sympathetic face responded that there were no <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject"
					>first-aid centres</term> on the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Pest</placeName> bank, but he did
				not think I had any problem with my face, it was at the most a little dirty. He suggested I should walk towards <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Erzsébet Bridge</placeName>, where there was a <term
					ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">first-aid centre</term> also on the <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Buda</placeName> bank. Naturally, I could do nothing else but go that way. On
				the way, a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1105" type="subject">soldier</term> became suspicious of me
				and stood in my way. When I asked how I could cross <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Erzsébet
					Bridge</placeName>, whether it was possible now to cross it, he asked why I wanted to cross the bridge and what I was doing there
				anyway. I said I had visited a friend of mine, but he kept on interrogating me and asked where this friend lived. I said in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Lánchíd Street</placeName>. <q>Where is <placeName
						ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Lánchíd Street</placeName> and where do you live?</q> I said in <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Damjanich Street</placeName>, I indicated my old flat and he continued to ask
				me how I would get from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Erzsébet Bridge</placeName> to <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Damjanich Street</placeName>. When I explained him the route his suspicion
				disappeared and told me that bridges were still not being <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1105"
					type="subject">bombed</term>, and one could cross them. Later, I did not ask anything from anyone but ran through the bridge
				trying to evade <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-474">Arrow Cross</orgName> guards. <placeName
					ref="http://www.geonames.org/3054643/budapest.html">Kossuth Lajos Street</placeName> looked very bad.</p>
			<p>Finally, I got into <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-870" type="subject">Weiss Alice Hospital</term>!</p>
