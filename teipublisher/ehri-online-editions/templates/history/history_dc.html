Their motives varied from wanting to document the founding and development of the ghetto, its typical features, and life within it, the work of the members of its self-government, specific groups of prisoners or individuals and important phenomena to later capturing the course and extent of the catastrophe or collecting evidence and testimony for later use after the war. Still others wanted to keep alive the memory of their life in the ghetto, of their friends and fellow prisoners.</span>

For example, Josef Polák (1905–1965), an employee of the ghetto’s central registration office, published rescued material such as various summaries and statistics after the war, firstly in collaboration with the journalist Zdeněk Lederer (1920–1981),<sup>

He likely put together a collection containing art and literature as well as documents on the work of the Jewish self-government during the year 1944. After he was deported to <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-0">Auschwitz</a> in the fall of 1944, his future wife Alisa continued with the effort (more about this in Daniel Shek’s introduction). After liberation, she brought the preserved documents to Prague, where <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000738">Schek</a> had returned to fromKaufering. His experience of other concentration camps, in which he apparently came to realize the extent and impact of the catastrophe that had befallen European Jewry, spurred him to decide to continue collecting documents of what had happened during the war in a systematic way and on a much larger scale, so that “</span>

Apart from a few exceptions, the contents of which are more akin to an attempt at a summary or memoir (e.g. the reminiscences of Cäcilie Friedmannová or Erich Nasch), the testimonies, in accordance with the Campaign’s guidelines, are brief and concise accounts of wartime events, a good example of which is Marianna Meissnerová’s statement.<sup>

<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">Just like in many other European countries, many people in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia sought to record what happened during the occupation by collecting authentic documents both while the war was still ongoing and immediately after liberation. Such activities in the Bohemian Lands, however, were fairly specific and have few things in common with other European initiatives, particularly those described by Laura Jockusch.<sup>

<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">From the outset, the group around <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000738">Zeev Schek</a> focused on documenting the work of the Zionists. Through the material they collected, they wanted to inform future generations of their firm stance and deliberate actions, loyalty to their ideals even in the harsh conditions of the ghetto, and active resistance to oppression and persecution by educating the young and promoting cultural activities. Later on, Schek himself coined the term </span>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;"> and even after war concentrated on documenting related phenomena and actions. For Zionist institutions, the Campaign also documented prominent members of the movement, its heroes, and focused on providing pictorial documentation of sites of persecution for promotional and informational purposes. Additionally, it sought to record the fate of Czech Jews not held prisoner in the Terezín Ghetto by drawing on examples.</span>

<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">Collecting documents inTerezín was the manifestation of an active outlook on life, a refusal to give in, a faith in the future and in the survival of the Jewish people, and the belief that life would go on after the war. Unlike the traumatization of the collectors in other countries that Jockusch writes about, the Campaign’s staff maintained this attitude even after the war. Despite the immensity of the tragedy that befell the Jewish population of Bohemia and Moravia, <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000738">Schek</a> and his colleagues represented the active and objective approach, all while looking ahead towards life in the Jewish state.</span>

<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">Time constraints, as the Campaign only operated in the Bohemian Lands for several months, and the insufficient expertise of its staff led it to refrain from assessing its own material. Most of the Campaign’s members hailed from a generation that had taken up their professions or specializations after the war; a majority was only a little over 20 years of age at the time. None were historians or representatives of other humanities disciplines; only the lawyer Robert Weinberger was able to make use of his pre-war education. <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000738">Schek</a> acted in a more intuitive way and, in many cases, responded to the possibilities available to him. His attempts at establishing contacts with other European documentation initiatives, with whom he could confer about methodology and share experiences, seem to have gone unanswered. At home, he could find only limited direct inspiration, for instance in the gathering of witness testimonies for the Extraordinary People’s Courts.</span>

A rare and inspiring story. To both of them, each in their own way, an invisible hand brought forth a drop from the small and miserly cup of miracles that delivered children, women, and men from the horror the Nazis set upon Europe and all of human history. The same wondrous hand later reunited them—after snatching Ze’ev from the grasp of the Angel of Death, who, after a long chase through various labor camps and death camps, had nearly caught up with him at the Kaufering concentration camp. This same hand completed its mission by letting my parents fulfill their Zionist dream, a dream of making aliyah, having a family, and building the state.</span>

<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">Ze’ev, who grew up in a strictly Jewish orthodox family in the Moravian town of Olomouc, was in Prague when the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia. He had settled there to pursue his dreams of Zionism and his fondness for soccer, as he liked to describe his decision to leave his family and religious way of life. By the time he was deported to the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449">Terezín Ghetto</a>, he was already in a relationship with Alisa, who would become his wife and partner until his death in 1978, at the young age of 58.</span>
                                </p>
<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">From the moment he arrived at the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449">Terezín Ghetto</a>, he became obsessed with the need to document what was going on around him, as if he had anticipated that the Nazis would try to cover up and that the rest of the world would refuse to believe the atrocities happening across Europe. This was a mortally dangerous task, since the Nazis knew as well that there might come a day of reckoning for them, and so, collecting any kind of documentation was strictly forbidden. And yet, with the help of Alisa, he managed to safeguard all kinds of documents, from worthless ghetto-money to proclamations by the ghetto commander.</span>

<p>

<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">Ze’ev’s obsession with documentation did not end with the war. Upon his return to Prague, he promptly began to gather the documents he and Alisa had safeguarded and many more items from other sources. These efforts continued well into the 1950s, including during his posting as a diplomat at the Israeli embassy in Prague, and he found ways to ship dozens and dozens of boxes to Israel, where they are safely archived at the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002798">Yad Vashem Archives</a> and <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002777">Beit Terezin</a>. He considered the “ingathering of the archives” no less important than the “ingathering of the exiles” (encouraging Jews from around the world to immigrate to Israel). There is evidence that throughout his career he never stopped asking people to hand over their personal archives to the relevant institutions in Israel.</span>
                                </p>
<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">Not surprisingly, he was also among the founders of <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002777">Beit Terezin</a> in Israel, a place of living memory and documentation of this very unique episode of the history of the Holocaust.</span>
                                </p>
<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">However, he was not one to live his life in the past. Far from that. He chose what is a fundamentally optimistic profession – diplomacy – where he could put the Zionist ardor of his youth to precious service for the young Jewish state. The Holocaust was never a taboo subject in our home. It was present, not as a threatening shadow, but rather the opposite. Perhaps as a source of strength and as proof that life, in spite of everything, is worth living to the fullest. This was the spirit of the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449">Terezín Ghetto</a>: unarmed resistance and the triumph of the spirit, with a little Czech humor mixed in.</span>
                                </p>
<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">My father developed mental strengths and a grandeur that astound us to this day. Thus, he volunteered, as part of his functions in the Israeli Foreign Ministry, to be part of the delegation that conducted the negotiations for establishing diplomatic relations with Germany. Courage and greatness of spirit were required of my parents to receive in our home in Jerusalem the first German ambassador, </span>
                                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolf_Friedemann_Pauls">

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">. For my parents this was not about forgiveness or pardon, but about a sober understanding that it was the right thing to do -right on the national level as well as on the human personal level. Each, in their own way, had turned a page. Not because they wanted to forget the disaster they and millions of others had experienced, but because they understood that it is not possible to change the already-written pages of history, whereas it is indeed possible to fill the blank pages of the future with better things.</span>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;"> (hereafter the Council), closed his opening remarks on the role of Jewish Religious Communities (hereafter JRC) after the war with the following words: “Always and in every era, the JRC in Prague was present and performed the tasks assigned to it in an exemplary manner. We have no doubt that even now, after liberation, on the ruins of Prague and the Czech Jewry, the JRC in Prague will diligently fulfil its tasks for the benefit of the Jews and of the state.”<sup>
                                            <a id="footnote2-ref" href="#footnote2">2</a>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;"> He thus articulated the central position of the Jewish community leadership in the renewal of Jewish life after 1945, in the personal and material restitution of the survivors, and in the relationship between the Jewish communities and the Czechoslovak state.</span>

<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">Representatives of the Jewish communities believed that it was their task to support the survivors in their efforts to begin a new life after the war, a truly Herculean effort. The Jewish community in Czechoslovakia immediately after the war was less than 15 percent of what it had been before 1939. Fewer than 25,000 Jews now lived in the Bohemian Lands, and in Slovakia about 30,000.<sup>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;"> Most suffered from significant health and psychological problems, lacked adequate housing and social security, and encountered major problems in their efforts to rejoin the postwar society (see the <a href="https://documentation-campaign.ehri-project.eu/exhibits/show/about/sedlicka-introduction">introduction by Magdalena Sedlická</a>), all while the specter of antisemitism and Czech ethnic nationalism frequently lurked in the background.</span>
                                </p>
<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">Before the German occupation, the JRC had focused purely on religious, educational, and charitable activities.<sup>
                                            <a id="footnote4-ref" href="#footnote4">4</a>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;"> In 1945, it became evident that these institutions would have to extend their range of activities far beyond their pre-war scope, because they effectively remained the only functioning Jewish organizational structures in the Bohemian Lands. Apart from religious services, therefore, they had to focus on the physical, social, and economic recuperation of the survivors and repatriates, negotiate with Czechoslovak authorities about the restitution of community property and property owned by individual Jews, provide the survivors with legal advice and answer enquiries from all over the world about the fate of thousands of individuals. Because of the lack of direct political Jewish representation in the government and state institutions, the new JRC also became the main political body that claimed to represent Jews in the Bohemian Lands. They made numerous interventions and entered into lengthy negotiations with the government to secure the position of the Jews in the country. Alongside all these activities, they also supported efforts to document the persecution of the Jews during the war, collect evidence for trials, and commemorate those who perished in the ghettos and concentration camps (see the introduction by Magda Veselská).<sup>

<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">The postwar Jewish communities in the Bohemian Lands initially lacked experienced leaders as well as the trust of the survivors. The wartime Czech Jewish and Czech Zionist leadership had been almost completely wiped out. </span>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;"> Other prewar Czechoslovak Jewish leaders had permanently settled abroad—in Palestine, Great Britain, and the United States. Furthermore, the ties between the Jewish community and their representatives had been severely harmed during the occupation. For many Jews, the Jewish Councils had been the puppets of the Nazi administration and this resentment persisted even after liberation. On several occasions, members of the leadership defended themselves in public and tried to persuade the anxious community that they were doing their utmost to secure equal rights and support the survivors.<sup>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">The establishment of a united Jewish Community organization and the equal representation of Zionists and Assimilationists signified a fundamental shift in the Jewish politics of the Bohemian Lands, and contrasted with its previous long history of infighting.<sup>
                                            <a id="footnote17-ref" href="#footnote17">17</a>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;"> In the borderlands, some of the leading positions were taken up by representatives of Jewish orthodoxy who came from Subcarpathian Ruthenia and until 1945 didn’t represent any significant group in the Bohemian Lands. Furthermore, the Council and other Jewish bodies decided to look after the interests of all Jews who had been affected by persecution (based on the Nuremberg Laws), not only those who would have been members of prewar Jewish religious communities.<sup>
                                            <a id="footnote18-ref" href="#footnote18">18</a>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;"> They realized that because of the wartime terror, every individual who had been affected by the Nazi policies, many of them without surviving relatives and family networks, had special needs and required long-term support, which the Czechoslovak state could not provide.</span>

<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">The agenda of the JRC was constantly expanding and the Council soon had to create an extensive administrative apparatus. In the first days after liberation alone, hundreds of letters arrived from overseas, enquiring about the fate of family members and friends and bombarding the newly opened offices, taking up the majority of the administration’s time. In two years, between November 1945 and October 1947, the Council received 125,000 letters and telegrams, and dispatched 75,000 letters and 4,000 telegrams.<sup>
                                            <a id="footnote19-ref" href="#footnote19">19</a>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;"> Another problem that troubled the Council from the very beginning was a lack of financial resources. Initially, survivors received extra food from the local population and in hospitals, and were allocated new apartments (mostly vacated by expelled Germans, though often large groups of survivors had to share one apartment).<sup>
                                            <a id="footnote20-ref" href="#footnote20">20</a>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;"> However, such help was short-lived and the Jewish community soon had to search for other sources. In 1946, the Council was successful in obtaining 60 million Czech crowns from the Czechoslovak government, part of the so-called ‘<a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449">Terezín</a> Estate’ (</span>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">Social services for survivors soon took up most of the Council’s agenda. The social department of the Council saw to the health of the survivors (many of whom were infected with tuberculosis), and established nursing homes, orphanages, and recreation centers for young people. They distributed clothes and other appliances from confiscated Jewish property left behind by the Germans. They also supported survivors with immediate financial help and provided monthly subsidies to those unable to sustain themselves.<sup>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">Czechoslovak Jews held high hopes for a better life after the end of the Second World War. Memoirs from the period express the deep sadness from losing so many of their loved ones and of their disappointment in the majority population’s attitude towards them. What was the new Czechoslovakia to which the Jewish survivors returned really like? What did they have to do to fully integrate into society, and was this really possible? The period after the end of the Second World War was full of uncertainty and change for Czechoslovak Jews returning home mostly from concentration camps, tours of duty in foreign armies, or countries to which they had emigrated. The main Czechoslovak politicians, led by Edvard Beneš, became strong advocates of the new republic’s national homogenization. Any efforts by Jews to have their minority rights acknowledged were seen as a potentially dangerous precedent.<sup>

While the main political leaders worked on ensuring moral and legal continuity with the First Republic, they also distanced themselves from some of its principles, which ended up being of vital importance to Jewish citizens. The Second World War left deep wounds in the society, and the postwar atmosphere was marked by fervent nationalism, a growing thirst for revenge, and the desire to punish the guilty. Following article will focus mainly on two groups of Jews in Czechoslovakia, which were affected the most by the changes of the state minority policy: Jews from the territories that had been ceded to the Soviet Union (Subcarpathian Ruthenia) in June 1945 and “German Jews”</span>

                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">The topic of citizenship in postwar Czechoslovakia was closely linked to the issue of language. The new republic was to be a state of Czechs and Slovaks; anyone else was supposed to adapt or leave. German speakers were automatically suspect and had to prove why they should be considered “Czech” when they didn’t speak the state language. “German Jews” often didn’t conform to this new concept of Czechoslovak citizenship, and, instead of granting them a certificate of state and national reliability, officials accused them of so-called Germanization. This made them part of the category “Germans”, often with existential consequences since, if a “German Jew” didn’t obtain an exception, they were no longer considered Czechoslovak citizens, couldn’t receive state support, and, as Germans, could even be forcibly deported. Kateřina Čapková, who drew on UNRRA sources for her article, believes that, in reality, a number of “German Jews” were indeed expelled by the authorities, however, it’s impossible to determine the exact number of such deportees.<sup>

Applicants were subsequently evaluated using a checklist of so-called objective characteristics, for instance the information they had put down in the pre-war census, their membership in associations, and knowledge of Czech or Slovak language. In the event that Jewish optants from Subcarpathian Ruthenia didn’t meet these conditions, their rejection notification was sent to the district national committee, which arranged for the applicants to be transported to the USSR repatriation center in Letná in Prague.<sup>

<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">The postwar era was extremely nationalistic, the mood in the Czechoslovak society strongly anti-German and anti-Hungarian as in many other European countries. The change in the state’s policy towards minorities had an enormous impact on the Jewish community. Leading political representatives believed in the dysfunctionality of the First Republic’s system of minority protection—Czechoslovakia was to become a homogeneous ethnic state, a territory for Czechs and Slovaks only.</span>
                                </p>
<p>
                                    <span style="font-weight:400;">In the postwar period, the Jewish inhabitants of Czechoslovakia and its neighboring countries faced similar problems, one of which was the distrust of the majority population. Jews were once again confronted with beliefs that they represented a foreign element, that they behaved in a suspicious manner, and were disloyal. Adapting to the postwar reality was difficult for survivors and filled them with feelings of uprootedness, loneliness, and disillusionment, but there were also important differences between the European countries. The situation of Jews in the Bohemian Lands was in no way ideal or simple, yet the main obstacles they faced were bureaucratic in nature. Being denied a certificate of state and national reliability or not receiving Czech citizenship had serious existential consequences, i.e. being downgraded to a second-class citizen. The “German Jews” were in danger of being deported and Jewish optants of being returned to territories now under Soviet control. Fortunately, however, Jews in the Bohemian Lands weren’t victims of physical attacks, and most of the abuse they suffered was in the form of verbal assaults, insults, and vulgar epithets. No openly anti-Semitic violence occurred in the Bohemian Lands as it did in neighboring Poland<sup>

<p>As recent scholarship has demonstrated, it was not only in the 1960s, with the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000107">Eichmann</a> trial, or in the 1980s, with <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-001624">Claude Lanzmann’s</a> “Shoah,” that the memory of the Holocaust emerged.<sup>
                                        <a id="footnote1-ref" href="#footnote1">1</a>
                                    </sup> From the immediate postwar period and onwards, different actors, most of them Jewish survivors, sought to bear witness to the persecution and murder of the Jews during the Second World War and did so in different ways—by publishing eyewitness and literary accounts of their own suffering, producing films, writing about the Holocaust in the press (mostly, but not exclusively, in the media of the reestablished Jewish communities), collecting material about the persecution of the Jews, and working to create the first monuments and memorials in public spaces and in Jewish cemeteries.<sup>
                                        <a id="footnote2-ref" href="#footnote2">

                                </p>
<p>Why, then, has the idea of a blank space in Holocaust memory and of survivors’ “silence” circulated for such a long time?<sup>
                                        <a id="footnote3-ref" href="#footnote3">

                                    </sup> The reasons must be sought in the perceptions and attitudes of the society at large rather than within Holocaust memory itself. Postwar nationalism and narratives of wartime heroism have contributed to the marginalization of Nazi antisemitism and the Holocaust as minor aspects of the history of the Second World War, externalizing them as parts of German and Jewish history, but not of respective “national” historical narratives.</p>
<p>In postwar Czechoslovakia, these dynamics were more pronounced since the Second World War was seen as the culmination of the age-old conflict between Czechs and Germans in the Bohemian Lands. The indifference of Czech postwar society towards the fate of their fellow Jewish citizens was evident already at the very end of the war. Moreover, Jews in postwar Czechoslovakia had to face two major accusations—they were either passive victims during the war or, even worse, a nationally “unreliable” and disloyal element. Indeed, the fact that, in the past, a portion of the Jewish population in the Bohemian Lands had spoken German and/or had identified with German nationality contributed to the stereotype of Jews as Germans, i.e. foreign elements and enemies of the Czech nation—an important aspect of Czech antisemitism since the 19<sup>th</sup> century.<a href="#_ftn4"/>
                                    <sup>
                                        <a id="footnote4-ref" href="#footnote4">4</a>
                                    </sup>The result was that commemorating the Holocaust did not make any sense in the nationalist atmosphere of the early postwar period. For the reconstruction of the Czechoslovak state, the only meaningful thing was the memory of Czech and Slovak suffering and “patriotic” resistance during the Second World War.</p>
<p>Numerous representatives and Jewish community members criticized this indifference towards the Holocaust in the immediate postwar years. The Czech-Jewish author František Langer, for instance, reported in 1946 that many in the society were focusing on the suffering of the non-Jewish Czechs during the war and all too quickly forgetting, leading to the “easy exclusion of the fate of the Jews from the consciousness of other people.”<sup>
                                        <a id="footnote5-ref" href="#footnote5">

                                    </sup> In a similar way, Štěpán Engel, a regular contributor to the publications of the Council of Jewish Religious Communities in postwar Czechoslovakia, spoke about “statistical forgetfulness,” i.e. the tendency to omit Jewish victims in Czechoslovak reports about the Second World War.<sup>
                                        <a id="footnote6-ref" href="#footnote6">

                                    </sup> Many Jewish survivors who returned to their hometowns from ghettos, concentration camps, or exile experienced hostility. They perceived this, too, as an “injustice, when you read everywhere of the atrocities that people have suffered, and the poor Jews are not mentioned anywhere.”<sup>
                                        <a id="footnote7-ref" href="#footnote7">

                                        <a id="footnote8-ref" href="#footnote8">

                                    </sup> He therefore insisted that it was a “Jewish duty” to document the Nazi persecution and murder of the Jews, since Czech authorities were only interested in recording the Nazi persecution of Czechs and Slovaks and in the history of Czechoslovak resistance.<sup>

                                    </sup> The Czechoslovak state and society did not forbid expressions of Holocaust remembrance, at least until the Communist takeover in 1948, but they took no notice of the specific persecution the Jews had been subjected to. This resulted in a sort of separation of the “Czech” and “Jewish” memory of the Second World War, which can be observed since 1945 and, to a certain extent, still persists today.<sup>
                                        <a id="footnote10-ref" href="#footnote10">

<p>One example perfectly illustrates this assessment: the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/cz-002302">Terezín memorial</a>.<sup>

                                    </sup> Terezín, or Theresienstadt, has a double meaning in the Czech context, corresponding to its dual role in the history of the Second World War. It has a “<a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-places-place-jmp-49">Small Fortress</a>,” i.e. the former Gestapo prison for the Czech national (and communist) resistance, and a “<a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449">Main Fortress</a>,” commonly called the “<a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449">Theresienstadt Ghetto</a>,” associated with the Holocaust and the Nazi persecution of the Jews. In the immediate postwar period, Jewish survivors wanted to preserve the site of the former ghetto and the town of <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449">Terezín</a> as a “memorial for all time.”<sup>
                                        <a id="footnote12-ref" href="#footnote12">
                                            <span>12</span>
                                        </a>
                                    </sup> Therefore, the Council of Jewish Religious Communities in Czechoslovakia, in cooperation with the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/cz-002279">Jewish Museum in Prague</a>, appointed the so-called “Terezín commission.” Its priority was preserving the “Jewish cemetery” outside the fort’s walls, where the early victims of the ghetto had been buried before the crematorium was built (in this same cemetery). Another project was the creation of a memorial on the banks of the Ohře River, where, in 1944, the Nazis had dumped the ashes of more than 20,000 Jewish victims. The plans of this commission included the unveiling of commemorative plaques in the town of Terezín and the installation of panels at the town’s main road, informing visitors and passersby about the history of the former <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449">Terezín Ghetto</a>. The “<a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449">Terezín</a> commission” even proposed setting up a museum in the town of Terezín that would commemorate the history of the former Jewish ghetto and would preserve the accommodations from the time of the ghetto in an “authentic” way.</p>
<p>However, when in 1947 the official <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/cz-002302">Terezín Memorial</a> was eventually established, it was done on the site of the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-places-place-jmp-49">Small Fortress</a>. Following the strong wave of patriotism in the immediate postwar period, the memorial was named the “<a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/cz-002302">Memorial of National Suffering.</a>” The “National Cemetery” was built in front of the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-places-place-jmp-49">Small Fortress</a>, where, in the future, major events, especially national rallies commemorating the Second World War every May, were organized. Nowhere was it mentioned that the majority of the human remains buried in the “National Cemetery” were Jewish victims of the ghetto.</p>
<p>The plans of the Jewish community to unveil commemorative plaques and to build a museum could not be realized. Suggestions to underscore the high number of Jewish victims buried in the “National Cemetery” fell on deaf ears. Already in 1946, representatives of the Jewish community had stated that the atmosphere in the town was characterized by indifference toward the memory of the Holocaust. Many Czechs who began to resettle in the town of Terezín in 1946 tried to acquire or reacquire houses. Their attempts to hastily renovate them frustrated the idea of preserving the objects for a museum.<sup>
                                        <a id="footnote13-ref" href="#footnote13">
                                            <span>13</span>
                                        </a>
                                    </sup>
                                </p>
<p>Finally, only two sites served as reminders of the history of the Jewish <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449">ghetto in Terezín</a>. A small monument could be erected by the Ohře River, but any reference to Jewish victims was removed in 1946. The site was not generally accessible because it was part of a military zone. The “Jewish Cemetery” with the crematorium represented, therefore, one of the main “lieux de mémoire” of the Holocaust for the post-war Jewish community in Czechoslovakia. Yet, both sites remained marginal—they were not perceived as an integral part of the official <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/cz-002302">Terezín Memorial</a> and it was only owing to the efforts of the Jewish community that these sites were maintained. Moreover, both stood outside the fortress of Terezín and were thus hardly visible to visitors and passersby.</p>
<p>The situation in post-war Terezín reminds us of the obstacles that the memory of the Holocaust encountered in Czechoslovak society at large. The patriotic, nationalistic, and ethnocentric perception of the war led to the marginalization of the Holocaust and to a clear separation between “our” Czech and “their” Jewish history. The Second World War was perceived as a prolongation and climax of the eternal conflict between Czechs and Germans. The Jews merged with the Czech victims; no clear distinction was made between the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-places-place-jmp-49">Small</a> and the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449">Main Fortress</a>; and the number of prisoners of the Small Fortress was exaggerated in order to balance, or even invert, the quantitative importance of the two parts of Terezín.<sup>
                                        <a id="footnote14-ref" href="#footnote14">

                                        </a>
                                    </sup> According to most publications from the early postwar period, the prisoners of “Terezín”—in the singular form, as if Terezín had been one camp—were “Czech people” and “patriots,” suffering and fighting for the Czech homeland, “dying so that the Czech nation may live.”<sup>
                                        <a id="footnote15-ref" href="#footnote15">
                                            <span>15</span>

                                    </sup>
                                </p>
<p>This marginalization of Holocaust memory in Czech society did not, however, lead to its suppression, and that is true, too, for the period following the Communist takeover in February 1948. For instance, Jewish survivors in Czechoslovakia met every year at the Jewish cemetery in Terezín to commemorate the Holocaust. They erected numerous commemorative plaques and memorials in Jewish cemeteries all over Czechoslovakia, and Jewish writers and journalists continued to publish accounts of the Holocaust. The exhibition of children’s drawings from the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449">Terezín Ghetto</a>, which the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/cz-002279">State Jewish Museum in Prague</a> had prepared in the 1950s, met with international success. Nevertheless, it was not until the 1990s that larger segments of Czech society took notice of these manifestations of Holocaust memory.</p>
