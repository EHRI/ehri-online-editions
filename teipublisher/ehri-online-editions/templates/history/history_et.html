            <h2 id="ballkaduri">The Ball-Kaduri Testimony Collection (Yad Vashem)</h2>

    <div>
                                    <p>Dr. Kurt Ball-Kaduri was born in Berlin in 1891. A lawyer and legal adviser to the Prussian government, he was also active in Jewish affairs. He made Aliyah to Eretz Israel in December 1938.</p>
<p>Ball-Kaduri, who was active in collecting material and writing about German Jewry, became aware that much material that reached the archives regarding Jewish life in Germany from 1933 to 1945 was incomplete and that there were large information gaps.</p>
<p>He decided to gather testimonies of people involved in Jewish life and the activities of Jewish organizations. In 1943, Ball-Kaduri began to collect the information and actually established his <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/il-002798-o_1">collection</a>. He contacted various people in Eretz Israel whom he knew, asking them to write their recollections and interviewing some of them himself. In 1955 he handed the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/il-002798-o_1">collection</a> over to <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002798">Yad Vashem</a> while continuing to collect related documentation for <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002798">Yad Vashem</a> until 1960.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/il-002798-o_1">collection</a> includes testimonies of Jewish leaders in various areas of Jewish life in Germany. Although it includes significant documentation regarding the fate of individual victims of the Holocaust, the main emphasis of the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/il-002798-o_1">Record Group</a> is on the different Jewish organizations.</p>
<p>There are over 300 files in the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/il-002798-o_1">record group</a>. Most of the collection is written in German and about half of the testimonies have been translated into Hebrew.</p>

<div> <h2 id="documentationcampaign">Documentation Campaign in Prague</h2>
    <div>
                                        <p>
                                            <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/cz-002279">The Jewish Museum in Prague</a>, whose history is intrinsically intertwined with the persecution of Bohemian and Moravian Jews, has been collecting archival sources relating to the persecution and genocide of Jews in the Czech lands since the end of WWII. It holds various types of materials, including interviews with and witness accounts of Shoah survivors.</p>
<p>The testimonies presented within the EHRI online edition were gathered mainly in the framework of the so-called “documentation campaign” (Dokumentační akce). This was one of the earliest postwar projects to document the events of the Shoah, collecting evidence, documents, and witness testimonies. The founder and a driving force behind the campaign was Zeev Scheck, a prewar Zionist and survivor of Theresienstadt and Auschwitz, who emigrated Palestine in 1946 to. He later worked as an Israeli diplomat and was an initiator of the Association of Theresienstadt Prisoners which built the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002777">Beit Theresienstadt archive and museum</a>.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from his wartime clandestine documentation in Theresienstadt and from a visit to Budapest after liberation, Scheck and a few of his former fellow prisoners initiated a Czechoslovak Jewish documentation effort. Scheck was thereby continuing the clandestine collection of documents in the Theresienstadt ghetto in which he and a group of Zionist youth activists had been involved. After liberation, Scheck’s partner and future wife transferred his Theresienstadt collection to Prague, later moving it to Palestine. Today it forms the basis of the Theresienstadt documentation in the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002798">Yad Vashem Archives</a>.</p>
<p>The “documentation campaign” in Prague was established with the assistance of the Jewish Agency for Palestine (Sochnut) and the EZRA committee and was operated by the Jewish community in Prague. The collection effort was conducted by a small group of about four young enthusiastic Zionist activists, all freshly liberated from ghettos and camps, for whom the documentation of the destruction was just a first necessary step towards the renewal of the Jewish nation in Palestine. They cooperated closely with the Jewish communities in the Czech lands and appealed in postwar community bulletins to the Jewish public to provide documentation of the persecution. Taking inspiration from the Budapest documentation efforts and under the auspices of the Jewish Agency, they collected lists of antisemitic literature, anti-Jewish laws, documents, photographs, testimonies, as well as artwork including literary reflections of persecution. They collected wartime documents still left in the offices and storages of the Jewish community and traveled to Theresienstadt and other places of persecution to secure surviving materials. They cooperated with the Czechoslovak investigation of Nazi crimes and provided, in the context of the denationalization and expulsion of Bohemian and Moravian Germans, materials for exhibitions documenting Nazi crimes.</p>
<p>Even if much more limited in staff and scope, as well as the amount of collected material, the “documentation campaign” was aware of the pan-European context of its work, especially from the perspective of Jewish nationalism. In a report to the Jewish Agency in August 1945, Scheck also implored its donors to “urgently” organize a meeting of representatives of committees from all states where such documentation was taking place.</p>
<p>The “documentation dampaign” in Prague was in operation for only a short period of time. When Zeev Scheck emigrated to Palestine in 1946, he took a part of the documents and testimonies with him, which he handed over to the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002782">Zionist Central Archives</a> and then to the Jewish Historical Archives (now the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002781">Central Archives for the History of the Jewish people</a>). In 1976, Scheck’s sources were transferred to <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002798">Yad Vashem</a>. Fragments of the material also found their way to the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002777">Beit Theresienstadt memorial, museum, and archives</a> in Givat Haim, which Scheck had helped to create. Following an arrangement, copies of some materials and documents with a clear relationship to Czechoslovakia remained in Czechoslovakia and were stored in the Archives of the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/cz-002279">Jewish Museum in Prague</a>.</p>
<p>The testimonies today held in the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/cz-002279">Jewish Museum in Prague</a> and in the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002798">Yad Vashem Archives</a> make up only a small portion of the documentation collected, especially in comparison with other documentation committees. It appears that the Prague activists took less inspiration from the grassroots Jewish ethnographic and documentation work and that the collection of testimonies was not entirely systematic. Some were recorded when witnesses visited the small office of the “documentation campaign” in the offices of the Prague Jewish community organization; some were requested due to the knowledge of specific events; yet again others were sent in by those who read or heard about the activity of the committee. It seems that no binding methodology or catalogue of questions was followed during the interviews.</p>
<p>Testimonies gathered within the “documentation campaign” were typed up and took the form of a protocol. Apart from some exceptions, the content often displays a very brief and terse character, with a focus on facts and the identification of perpetrators, with some exceptions. Most were compiled in 1945 and 1946 in either Czech or German.</p>

                                            <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/pl-003146-301">The Holocaust Survivors Testimonies collection (Record Group 301)</a> held in the archives of the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/pl-003146">Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw</a> consists of 6967 testimonies. It was established in 1944 and further testimonies were added to it over the years until 1995, when it was decided to close the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/pl-003146-301">collection</a>. The first accounts came from Lublin. On July 26, 1944 Lublin was liberated by the Red Army, and on August 10, the first Jewish organization – the Jewish Aid Committee – was established in this city. Activists of this committee, at first established as a social welfare institution, realized that the world should learn about the fate of Polish Jews during the war and that the seemingly unbelievable information about the scale of the Holocaust should be accurately documented. To this end, on August 29, 1944, they established the Jewish Historical Commission and immediately began to collect and write down the accounts of Jews coming out of hiding. The earliest report is dated August 20, namely Gertner’s account of the liquidation of the ghettos in Staszów and Sandomierz (the name of the witness and the data of the person recording the oral testimony are missing). On November 12, 1944, the Central Committee of Polish Jews (CKŻP) was established in Lublin, composed of representatives of various political parties. It assumed general management over Jewish institutions reestablished in Poland. On December 15, 1944, the Central Jewish Historical Commission (CŻKH), subordinated to the Central Committee of Polish Jews, was established. The commission was headed by the historian Filip Friedman, before the war a teacher in Jewish schools in Łódź, who survived the war in hiding in L’viv. As the Polish territories were being liberated, branches of the commission were established in various cities, the most active of which was the provincial commission in Kraków headed by Maksymilian Borwicz.</p>
<p>In 1945, the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/pl-003146-301">collection of testimonies</a> developed significantly. Not only people who came out of hiding, but also freed prisoners from concentration camps told about their experiences. Significant importance was attached to the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/pl-003146-301">collection of relacje</a> (testimonies, reports), which were not only to constitute a historical documentation, but were also to be used as evidence in war crimes trials. In 1945, CŻKH issued an instruction for persons gathering testimonies and a separate instruction for people who recorded children’s stories. While we have 44 accounts dated 1944 (which does not however give a full picture of the work of the commission, because many testimonies are not dated), there are 1221 dated accounts from 1945 and 982 accounts from 1946. From March 1945, the commission was based in Łódź. Provincial commissions were established in Białystok, Gdańsk, Katowice, Kraków, Lublin, Warsaw, and Wrocław, local commissions were established in Bielsko (today Bielsko-Biała), Częstochowa, Kielce, Kutno, Piotrków Trybunalski, Przemyśl, Radom, Tarnów, and Włocławek.</p>
<p>Jewish historical commissions were usually located in the same buildings as the local Jewish committees (branches of the Central Committee of Polish Jews). Jewish survivors reported to the committees on various matters, for example to register, to receive information about the family from whom they were separated during the war, or to receive material help. The employees of the historical commissions would incidentally turn to the persons visiting the committee and ask them to tell about their wartime fate. Many agreed, understanding the necessity of documenting the Jewish tragedy, but there were also those who did not want to return to the difficult experiences in the ghettos and concentration camps. Regarding such cases, one of the historical commission employees in Kraków suggested that the Jewish committees should impose the obligation on survivors to submit testimonies. This request was, of course, rejected.</p>
<p>CKŻH established relations with institutions responsible for prosecuting war criminals: the Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes, the Ministry of Justice, and the Supreme National Tribunal. In 1947, CŻKH, which after the departure of Friedman from Poland was directed by Nachman Blumental, was transferred to Warsaw and transformed into the Jewish Historical Institute. The local commissions were liquidated. The work on collecting the testimonies continued, with 1005 accounts dating from 1947, 615 from 1948, and finally 171 from 1949. In later years, after the departure of the majority of Jews from Poland, the gathering of testimonies was not continued, but they continued to flow in regardless. Gradually, there were fewer and fewer accounts of Jews or Poles of Jewish descent. The reports were often submitted by Poles who wanted to testify about their participation in helping Jews during the occupation (such statements were often accompanied by the confirmation of the truth of the story told, prepared by people who had helped). From 1950 to 1959, there were 322 reports, 564 from 1960 to 1969, 155 from 1970 to 1979, and finally 153 from 1980 to 1995. In addition, 17 reports were dated to the years 1941 to 1943, although most of these constituted post-war copies of documents (mainly letters) from the period of occupation. It should also be remembered that the collection contains 1218 undated testimonies, including reports from the early post-war years as well as later.</p>
<p>The majority of the accounts are written in Polish. The <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/pl-003146-301">collection</a> also contains 1176 testimonies in Yiddish, 264 in German, 25 (in whole or in part) in Russian, 17 (in whole or in part) in English, and 9 (in whole or in part) in Hebrew. In addition there are 11 reports written in Belarusian, Czech, French, Spanish, and Ukrainian, or containing attachments in one of these languages.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/pl-003146-301">Record Group 301</a> there are also testimonies from the occupation period in other collections. Among others, the Warsaw Ghetto Archive (Ringelblum Archive) contains accounts collected in the Warsaw Ghetto and concerning the fate of the Jewish population in other Polish towns in the years 1939 to 1942.</p>

<h2 id="koniuchowsky">The Koniuchowsky Testimony Collection (Yad Vashem)</h2>

    <div>
        <div>
                                        <p>Leyb Koniuchowsky was born in Lithuania on 18 November 1910. An engineer by profession, he resided in Kaunas (Kovno). During the German occupation, he lived in the Kaunas Ghetto where he worked until his escape. He found shelter in a bunker at a farmer’s home where he remained until the liberation of Lithuania by the Red Army in 1944.</p>
<p>From 1944 to 1946, he traveled through the war-battered towns of Lithuania, collecting testimonies from the few Jews that had survived. The testimonies focused on the extermination of the Jews and the destruction of the local towns and villages. Koniuchowsky was meticulous about the accuracy and authenticity of the information in the testimonies and even had the witnesses sign their testimonies. The testimonies include the names of thousands of victims of the Holocaust, the names of their murderers, and those who had collaborated with the Nazis.</p>
<p>Koniuchowsky continued to collect testimonies from the She’erit Hapletah (the “surviving remnant” – a biblical term used to refer to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust) in the DP camps in Germany, where he lived for a few years. <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002798">Yad Vashem</a> received the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/il-002798-3763421?dlid=eng-il_002798_o_71_10661014_eng">Koniuchowsky Collection</a> in 1989. The <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/il-002798-3763421?dlid=eng-il_002798_o_71_10661014_eng">collection</a> includes testimonies regarding 150 towns and villages in Lithuania and more than 30 towns in the Vilnius area.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/il-002798-3763421?dlid=eng-il_002798_o_71_10661014_eng">collection</a> is of special significance because it includes information gathered immediately after the liberation from eyewitnesses. Furthermore, the testimonies document the destruction of small communities, in places where few Jews had lived before the war, and with almost no survivors.</p>

                                        <h4>Creation of the National Committee for Attending Deportees</h4>
<p>In the first few months after the end of the war in Hungary in April 1945 there was no central organization capable of coordinating the revival of the remaining Jewish community and arranging the coherent distribution of relief aid coming in from three main sources: the International Red Cross, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (Joint), and the Jewish Agency for Palestine. To unify efforts, the National Jewish Aid Committee (Országos Zsidó Segítő Bizottság, OZSSB) was established on August 31, 1945. This organization integrated a number of independent groups implementing often overlapping support activities. The Joint, which provided the largest funds, recognized the new organization as the executive arm of the relief effort. As of August 31, the independent National Committee for Attending Deportees (<a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/hu-002736-visszaeml%C3%A9kez%C3%A9sek_gy%C5%B1jtem%C3%A9nye_1945_2010-pih_i_m">Deportáltakat Gondozó Országos Bizottság, DEGOB</a>) was absorbed into the OZSSB’s organizational structure.</p>
<p>In addition to aid and relief, <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/hu-002736-visszaeml%C3%A9kez%C3%A9sek_gy%C5%B1jtem%C3%A9nye_1945_2010-pih_i_m">DEGOB</a> performed important documentary work as well. A registration system was put in place to document data on survivors and victims. As part of the process, all returning deportees and labor servicemen were asked to list the names of survivors who had not yet returned to Hungary as well as data on those who had perished. Further, <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/hu-002736-visszaeml%C3%A9kez%C3%A9sek_gy%C5%B1jtem%C3%A9nye_1945_2010-pih_i_m">DEGOB</a> staff recorded the testimonies of more than 5000 survivors (2 percent of the Jewish survivors) of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>
                                            <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/hu-002736-visszaeml%C3%A9kez%C3%A9sek_gy%C5%B1jtem%C3%A9nye_1945_2010-pih_i_m">DEGOB</a> continued to perform its welfare and relief efforts until April 1950, when OZSSB was shut down and its responsibilities were taken over by the Central Welfare Committee of the National Office of Hungarian Israelites (Magyar Izraeliták Irodája Központi Szociális Osztály). In 1946, the information unit was absorbed by the Documentation Department of the World Jewish Congress.</p>
<h4>The Testimonies</h4>
<p>The earliest testimony of the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/hu-002736-visszaeml%C3%A9kez%C3%A9sek_gy%C5%B1jtem%C3%A9nye_1945_2010-pih_i_m">DEGOB collection</a> was created on December 12, 1944. This was obviously not authored by the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/hu-002736-visszaeml%C3%A9kez%C3%A9sek_gy%C5%B1jtem%C3%A9nye_1945_2010-pih_i_m">DEGOB</a> staff as the organization did not yet exist at this point. However, the document was later placed into the series of testimonies as Protocol 3659. In the spring of 1945, the Countryside Department of the Hungarian Association of Jews (Magyarországi Zsidó Szervezete Vidéki Osztálya) prepared similar documents, which also became part of the collection. The last testimony was taken on April 13, 1946.</p>
<p>
                                            <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/hu-002736-visszaeml%C3%A9kez%C3%A9sek_gy%C5%B1jtem%C3%A9nye_1945_2010-pih_i_m">DEGOB</a> employees recorded the testimonies by interviewing survivors according to a standard questionnaire. These were arranged into twelve topical groups (such as the characteristics of the Jewish community in the survivor’s original place of residence; events before 1944; the features of the ghetto; the circumstances of the deportation, arrival in the camp, and selection; life in the camp; evacuations, liberation, and the circumstances of homecoming, etc.). An important consideration for those assembling this material was to enable the creation of historically authentic documents. Survivors were asked whether “you know this firsthand or simply by hearsay?” Certain questions did not relate to concrete facts but rather to the survivor’s emotional and psychological reactions. (“What did you immediately notice when you arrived and how did your observations affect you?”) The overwhelming majority of questions enquired about concrete events and data. Thus, an immense amount of information was obtained about the Holocaust in Hungary.</p>
<p>The protocols were recorded using the so-called Gabelsberg-Markovits shorthand system and then typed up. The language was either Hungarian or German. Several Hungarian documents were translated into English and German. <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/hu-002736-visszaeml%C3%A9kez%C3%A9sek_gy%C5%B1jtem%C3%A9nye_1945_2010-pih_i_m">DEGOB</a> sent 16 volumes of protocol material to <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/us-005554">YIVO</a> in New York. 1200 protocols were submitted to the Hungarian authorities to investigate cases of war crimes. During the most intensive period (in the summer and autumn of 1945), 25 people worked at the Documentation Department of <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/hu-002736-visszaeml%C3%A9kez%C3%A9sek_gy%C5%B1jtem%C3%A9nye_1945_2010-pih_i_m">DEGOB</a>. By September 1946 its staff comprised only 8 people.</p>
<p>The documents are today held by the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/hu-002737">Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives</a>. A digitized version of the collection can be accessed at <a href="https://www.degob.hu">www.degob.hu</a> and <a href="https://www.degob.org">www.degob.org</a> since 2004.</p>

<h2 id="wiener">The Wiener Library and its Eyewitness Accounts</h2>

    <div>
        <div>
                                        <p>“We all have a duty to fulfil towards our past,” implored Dr. Eva Reichmann, the former Director of Research at the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/gb-003348">Wiener Library (WL)</a>, in a short <a href="https://ajr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1954_november.pdf">front-page appeal</a> in the journal of the Association of Jewish Refugees in the United Kingdom in November 1954. Reichmann’s impassioned appeal launched the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/gb-003348">WL’s</a> ambitious effort in the mid-1950s to record testimonies about the Holocaust.</p>
<p>This 1950s testimony project grew out of the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/gb-003348">WL’s</a> efforts to study and collect evidence about the rise of Nazism, which had already begun long before the Nazis came to power in 1933, and later the Holocaust. The <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/gb-003348">WL</a> traces its roots to Germany in the 1920s, when its namesake, Alfred Wiener, began to document, lobby, and speak out publicly against the rise of antisemitism. At the time, Wiener worked for the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith (Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens) to combat antisemitism and to collect information about the rise of the Nazis, which formed the basis of campaigns intended to undermine their activities. In 1933, Wiener fled from Germany to the Netherlands and his first collection of materials was destroyed. Later that year, he created the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO) with the help of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Anglo-Jewish Association. The JCIO continued the work of the earlier archive.</p>
<p>Following the November Pogrom in 1938, Wiener began to prepare to move the collections again, this time to the United Kingdom. It arrived during the summer of 1939, just before Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Throughout the war, the JCIO served the British government as it fought the Nazi regime. The collection was increasingly referred to as “Dr. Wiener’s Library” and eventually this led to its renaming.</p>
<p>After the war, the <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/gb-003348">WL</a> and its staff, many of whom were German-speaking Jewish refugees, made a concerted effort to gather the perspectives and experiences of the victims of persecution. This effort came at a time when other ‘early’ record- and testimony-collecting projects had begun to wind down, but before the widespread push to record survivor testimony of the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>Over a period of about seven years, and with financial support from The Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany, Eva Reichmann and her team gathered reports from refugees and survivors in the United Kingdom and abroad. The interviewees recounted their experiences of events from 1933 through to the end of the war as well as its aftermath. Calls for interviewees were issued in the British and continental European press, with many also found through networking and word-of-mouth. Trained interviewers – many of whom were often survivors or spouses of survivors – recorded, transcribed, edited, and indexed the accounts under Reichmann’s direction. In addition to survivors’ testimonies, the collection also includes contemporary documents and letters.</p>
<p>Reichmann and her associates began close to London and gradually spun out further and further as their network of interviewers and interviewees widened. Reichmann’s methodology was described in <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/gb-003348">The Wiener Library</a> Bulletin in autumn 1955:</p>
<p>Only occasionally the reports will be drawn up by the authors themselves; usually the eye witnesses are visited by one of the Library’s interviewers for one or more conversations. During these the interviewer tries to elicit as much information as possible and, on the strength of it, writes the report. This is submitted to the interviewed person to ensure that it contains no mistake or misunderstanding, and is subsequently incorporated into our archives. For the purposes of reference, it is analysed, catalogued and cross-indexed.</p>
<p>Unlike more contemporary projects that have collected survivor testimonies, which often seek to preserve the exact wording and recollections of the witness as they were stated, Reichmann and her team analyzed the reports for accuracy in dates and other criteria, annotated and corrected them, and ensured that the interviewee signed the updated eyewitness report.</p>
<p>At the same time, the annotations and related correspondence indicate that Reichmann and her colleagues tried to preserve to the greatest possible extent the character and meaning of the author of the report, particularly where they could not verify particular details or were unclear about certain forms of expression, especially from those who were writing in German but whose first language may have been something else.</p>
<p>The project successfully gathered more than 1,300 reports in seven different languages over a seven-year period and will serve as a new digital resource to be published by <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/gb-003348">the Wiener Library</a> in 2019.</p>

<h2 id="dpcamps">The Central Historical Commission of the Central Committee of Liberated Jews in the US Zone in Munich – Testimonies Collected in DP Camps (Yad Vashem)</h2>

    <div>
        <div>
                                        <p>The Munich-based Central Historical Commission (CHC) of the Central Committee of Liberated Jews in the US Zone began its collection of historical documentation in Germany in December 1945. Much effort was invested into soliciting the participation of Jews who were survivors of concentration camps in Germany in the collection activities. The immense response by the survivors perhaps expressed the spontaneous desire to perpetuate the memory of those who had perished and to document the horrors of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The CHC succeeded during the three years of its existence to collect over 2550 testimonies from Holocaust survivors from various countries in Europe that had been under German occupation.</p>
<p>One person who emphasized the importance of the survivors’ testimonies for the writing of the history of the period and the commemoration of the Holocaust was Israel Kaplan (1913–2000). Kaplan encouraged the survivors to write about their experiences and to respond to the CHC project for the collection of testimonies.</p>
<p>Israel Kaplan was a teacher, historian, and author who resided and was active in Kaunas. Following the German invasion and occupation of Kaunas and the establishment of the Kaunas Ghetto in the summer of 1941, Kaplan was interned in the ghetto along with his wife and children. As early as August 1941, during the first days after the establishment of the ghetto, Kaplan was appointed to secretly write about and record the events taking place in the Kaunas Ghetto.</p>
<p>In February 1942, Kaplan was deported to the Riga Ghetto, where he also succeeded in transferring a detailed report to Kaunas regarding the fate of the 450,000 Jews from Kaunas who were deported along with him to Riga. Kaplan was later also interned in the Siauliai Ghetto and in the Kaiserwald, Panevezys, Stutthof, and Dachau concentration camps. Kaplan and his son survived, but his wife and daughter perished in the Holocaust. His daughter, who was hidden by a Lithuanian woman, was captured in June 1944 and transferred to the Ninth Fort, where she was murdered. Kaplan’s wife perished during the liquidation of the Kaunas Ghetto in July 1944.</p>
<p>The CHC distributed, among other things, questionnaires to children in the DP camps in order to gather information related to the fate of the children and their families during the Holocaust. The questionnaires included questions regarding the names of family members, their places of origin, and the children’s general backgrounds. On the reverse side of each questionnaire a brief summary of the child’s story was recorded, starting from the day of deportation to the ghetto, the camps to where they were deported, the date of separation from their family members, and the places where the child stayed after liberation and until their arrival in the DP camp.</p>
<p>A unique collection within <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/il-002798-m_1">M.1</a> includes 423 questionnaires that were distributed to children in the Föhrenwald DP camp. The replies to these questionnaires reflect the suffering of Jewish children under Nazi occupation.</p>
<p>Upon the completion of the activities of the CHC in Munich in 1948, the documentation collected was transferred to <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/il-002798">Yad Vashem</a>.</p>
