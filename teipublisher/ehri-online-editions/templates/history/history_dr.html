<p>This is as a brief introduction to the knowledge of the persecution and murder of the Jews based on the written and preserved sources of the Danish Foreign Ministry from late 1938 to 1944. Denmark was occupied on 9 April<sup/>1940 and it is important to consider the unique relationship between the occupied and the occupier there. This is a prerequisite for contextualizing the sources and to understand the structure and continuity of Danish diplomacy that was possible due to the cooperation between Denmark and Germany.</p>

<h3>The Danish-German Relationship 1933-1945</h3>
<p>The relationship between Denmark and Germany from 1933 to 1945 is well researched. There is an overwhelming agreement on the nature of this relationship before the occupation period, while the years after April 9, 1940 still cause public and academic discussions regarding Denmark’s position. These debates often revolve around portraying Denmark as being neutral or belligerent, while the agreement between Denmark and Germany is often judged as being cooperative or collaborative. In the following, Denmark’s position before the occupation period is briefly summarized before Denmark’s relationship with Germany is analyzed more closely.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that Denmark followed a policy of neutrality in the period before the occupation on April 9, 1940. This was an attempt to duplicate the country’s successful strategy of neutrality during the First World War. From 1914 to 1918 Denmark had capitalized on trade by selling goods to both warring parties while steering clear of the armed conflict. Yet, in the 1930s the claims of the German dictatorship to incorporate German minorities was an ever-present concern for the Danish government due to the presence of a German minority in the border areas of Jutland. This issue started to dominate Danish foreign policy after Germany annexed Austria in the spring and the Sudetenland, a part of Czechoslovakia, in the fall of 1938. Since Germany’s territorial claims were backed by a rising military force, the conservatives in Denmark wanted to counter this threat by strengthening the Danish military forces, while the government, led by social democrats, feared this would provoke a German attack. In 1937 Denmark was increasingly militarily isolated. Great Britain declined to assist the country while plans for a Nordic military alliance fell through that year. Without allies, and anxious about Germany’s ambitions, Denmark thought peace was secured as it signed a pact of non-aggression with Germany on May 31, 1939.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">

                                        </p>
<p>The German military attack on Denmark and Norway was codenamed “Weserübung” and began in the early morning hours of 9 April 1940. The battle for Denmark only lasted hours, while the Norwegians capitulated on June 10. Denmark was now occupied and the historical term for the period remains <em>besættelsestiden – </em>the occupation period. Contrary to Norway, Denmark officially accepted the German diplomatic explanation for the attack which stated that the intention had not been to violate Danish neutrality or political independence, but instead had been to protect Denmark.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">

                                        </p>
<p>International research still debates if Denmark’s diplomatic status during the war should be considered as neutral or belligerent.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">
                                                <span>[3]</span>
                                            </a> However, most Danish historians argue that Denmark was not at war with Germany. Instead, Denmark is often described as neutral, occupied while remaining neutral or peacefully occupied.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">
                                                <span>[4]</span>
                                            </a> These perceptions are referred to as follows in the historiography: the peaceful occupation, (<em>fredsbesættelsen</em>) or the fiction of neutrality/sovereignty (<em>Neutralitets- og suverænitetsfiktionen</em>). Even contemporaries during the war viewed Denmark as a ‘special case’ compared to the rest of occupied Europe.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">
                                                <span>[5]</span>
                                            </a> It has recently been argued that the Danish political actors of the period presented Denmark’s status in a diplomatically flexible manner – ranging from neutral, non-belligerent, peacefully occupied to belligerent. The application of these terms depended on the developments of the war. For example, in the beginning of the war, Denmark’s status was often referred to as “neutral” while at the end of the war – with an increasing siting with the allied forces – it was characterized as “belligerent”.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">
                                                <span>[6]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>Contrary to most other occupied countries, Denmark dealt directly with the German Foreign Office in matters relating to the occupation. The cooperation broke down in August 1943, but until then Denmark maintained control over its government, the police, the courts and the Danish military. The line of communication with the occupiers was channeled through the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, though many minor and practical matters were solved without the involvement of the ministry.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">
                                                <span>[7]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>The Danish-German agreement does resemble other forms of relationships between Germany and different European countries during the Second World War. Several theoretical attempts have been made to define and categorize occupied, collaborationist, neutral or allied states in order to point to differences and similarities. However, Denmark often ends up in various categories depending on the theory applied.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">
                                                <span>[8]</span>
                                            </a> Going beyond these categories, historian John T. Lauridsen has argued that from a German point of view the German occupation policy in Denmark was essentially consistent until December 1943. The overall German goal was to maintain as much stability as possible and avoid introducing a new German occupation policy.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">
                                                <span>[9]</span>
                                            </a> Likewise, Philip Giltner points to a remarkable consistency in the German-Danish relationship in the economic sphere, which lasted throughout the war.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">
                                                <span>[10]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>In Danish historiography, the arrangement between Denmark and Germany has caused continued discussion about the term most suited to describe this relationship. The most dominant term remains cooperation, while collaboration has been applied by some historians. Recently, it seems the terms collaboration and cooperation have become equated in Danish research.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">
                                                <span>[11]</span>
                                            </a> I adhere to the following definitions: collaboration is the support of the occupying forces for reasons of personal self-interest or ideological conviction. Cooperation in the Danish case is defined as the conscious choice of most political and socioeconomic elites to cooperate with representatives of Nazi Germany to various degrees. This was motivated by a wish to preserve as much political power as possible from challengers on both sides of the political spectrum while attempting to save Denmark’s political structures as well as maintaining material gains. These motives justified accepting an increasing number of German demands in a self-enforcing logic of cooperation, which created unforeseen results. This means that the limits for cooperation were continuously pushed further as the war progressed, and what had been deemed unacceptable in April 1940 later became acceptable.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">
                                                <span>[12]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>The arrangement between Denmark and Germany is thus a complicated and fluid construction that also allowed Denmark to maintain diplomatic representation. Two events during the occupation in Denmark also affected the structure of Danish diplomacy significantly:</p>
<ol>
                                            <li>Denmark’s signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact on November 25, 1941.</li>
<li>In August 1943, the Danish government formally stepped down due to public up-risings and German demands to e.g. forbid strikes and introduce the death penalty for acts of sabotage. However, the state administration remained in place and this included the staff of the Danish Foreign Ministry.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">

</ol>
<h3>The structure of Danish diplomacy from 1940 onwards</h3>
<p>The cooperation secured the preservation of certain traits of a neutral country which allowed Denmark to maintain its diplomatic representations in many European states. At the same time, this period is also to be considered a period of disunity among the Danish diplomats, who normally exhibited a true <em>esprit de corps</em>. Let me first briefly recount the circumstances of this disunion as it will assist us in gaining an overview of Danish diplomatic representation from 1940 to 1945.</p>
<p>A major characteristic of the diplomats who did break ties with Copenhagen was that they largely resided in Allied or neutral countries. The first and most significant breach within the diplomatic corps originated from the Danish Envoy (Gesandter) in Washington, Henrik Kauffmann.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">
                                                <span>[14]</span>
                                            </a> As Denmark surrendered, Kauffmann went to President Roosevelt to declare that he was to be considered the representative of a free and independent people, thus severing his ties to the Danish government. He was accompanied by some of the Danish diplomats located on South America, but Kauffmann’s move was largely ignored by the Americans. This changed a year later as the defense of Greenland was turned over to the Americans in an agreement brokered by Kauffmann, who would sign on behalf of Denmark. This caused great displeasure in the Danish Foreign Ministry, which immediately fired Kauffmann, but the Americans rejected a new Danish envoy. The next wave of diplomats who declared their independence came after the Danish signature of the Anti-Comintern Pact in late 1941. The Danish envoy in London, Count Eduard Reventlow, was the first and was soon followed by Danish diplomats in Canada, Australia, and South America. After August 1943, which signified the formal end of the cooperation as the Danish government stepped down, another cohort of diplomats formally declared their independence of Copenhagen.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">

                                            <li>Austria</li>

</ul>
                                        <p>Denmark was not present in the Polish heartland of the Holocaust nor the areas of the so-called “Holocaust by bullets” – the Baltic States, Ukraine, Belarus or the USSR. The Danish legations were shut down in these areas through 1939 to 1941.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">

<p>In most German-occupied countries Denmark’s <em>Gesandtschaften </em>were turned into general consulates which maintained the same small staff levels as well as continuing almost as usual. The most important legation was in Berlin. It functioned as an information hub for exchanges and often forwarded messages from other diplomatic entities to the main office in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>These overall conditions created the diplomatic sources which make it possible to study how these professional observers and analysts of political affairs perceived events in one of Europe’s most turbulent periods. While these diplomats in occupied countries had to take into account both the Danish-German relationship as well as the demands of the local leadership, compared to other occupied countries Denmark had some of the best options to observe and sometimes even to intervene in the unfolding events on an individual level.</p>

<h3>Denmark and the European Jews 1933-1945</h3>
<p>Since 2000 research on Antisemitism, Denmark’s refugee policy, and knowledge of the persecution and murder of the Jews has provided us with many new insights. Antisemitism was present in several Danish organizations during this period, yet racial antisemitism was far from rampant, while more “modest” Antisemitic views were more prevalent in some of the organizations examined.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">
                                                <span>[17]</span>
                                            </a> The government sponsored research report on Denmark’s refugee policy from 1933 to 1943 which was published as four separate volumes stands out as a major step forward.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">
                                                <span>[18]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>The volumes document a Danish refugee policy towards Jews that was continuously tightened and as Denmark was occupied only a little more than 1500 Jewish refugees were in Denmark.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">
                                                <span>[19]</span>
                                            </a> Fears of a “Jewish question” coming into existence as well as high unemployment rates were the main factors behind this politically well supported refugee policy.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">
                                                <span>[20]</span>
                                            </a> The authors also reveal that during the occupation Danish authorities handed over at least 155 individuals who were later persecuted in Germany. Most of these were Communists, but 20 were Jews and 18 of these later perished in the camp system.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">
                                                <span>[21]</span>

                                        </p>
<p>In early 1943 Germany requested that Jewish citizens of German allies, countries affiliated with Germany or neutral countries were to return to their country of citizenship. Generally, Jews had been barred from relocating since 1941 due to German travel restrictions, but now this ban was lifted. Denmark also received this request, because Denmark’s cooperation had secured that Danish Jews residing in Europe had been exempted from deportation. In the first five months of 1943 at least 45 Jews were relocated to Denmark.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">

                                        </p>

<h3>Danish knowledge of the persecution and murder of the Jews from 1933-1945</h3>
<p>Danish knowledge of the persecution and murder of the Jews from 1933 to 1945 was only recently examined by different researchers whose publications differ in both length and focus.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">
                                                <span>[23]</span>
                                            </a> It is worth noting that all those who have worked with the sources of the Danish foreign ministry agree that following National Socialism’s anti-Jewish policy was not a top priority. Rather, policies of the Nazi regime which could affect Denmark and the border-issue were of the highest concerns.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the volumes on Denmark’s refugee policy, three chapters deal explicitly with the topic of knowledge of anti-Jewish measures. The authors point to the fact that they are only able to provide a broad overview.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">
                                                <span>[24]</span>
                                            </a> Nevertheless, this sketch is extremely well done. Research on the period from 1933 to 1939 has focused on Germany and shows that Danish knowledge of German anti-Jewish measures was extensive. From 1933 onwards, many incidents and most laws were registered by the Danish representatives. Most information came from the head of the legation in Berlin, Herluf Zahle, while several reports on events in Hamburg were filed by general consul Marinus Yde.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">
                                                <span>[25]</span>
                                            </a> Taken together, very few events were missed as all the waves of violence and legal measures against the Jews were recorded.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">
                                                <span>[26]</span>
                                            </a> Researchers have concluded that after 1937 the police, the bureaucrats and the politicians who were involved in establishing and enforcing Danish refugee policy “could be in no doubt that German Jews were living under horrible and inhumane conditions”.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">
                                                <span>[27]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>The existing research into the Foreign Ministry’s knowledge of events in Europe from 1940 to 1943 is similarly a broad but well-done overview. It examines the reports that made it to Copenhagen, while leaving the archives of the legations unexamined.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">
                                                <span>[28]</span>
                                            </a> Still, this research can be considered pioneering as it uses new sources and applies a European perspective to the matter at hand. Researchers have concluded that the Danish authorities were informed of the stigmatization, the financial exploitation, and the exclusion of the Jews in most Western European countries. They were aware of deportations from Germany while knowledge of deportations from other countries only became known as late as spring 1943. The known ghetto destinations were found to be associated with illness as well as malnutrition.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">
                                                <span>[29]</span>
                                            </a> The genocide itself, as it was presented through the BBC as well as in Swedish newspapers, was followed by the ministry as well. Researchers conclude that the Danes were aware that Jews were being murdered by September 1943.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">
                                                <span>[30]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>The knowledge of persecution and genocide in the Danish media has received scarce attention with the exception of the reception of Kristallnacht.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">
                                                <span>[31]</span>
                                            </a> However, one volume has thoroughly examined the knowledge on the Holocaust in the illegal prints and books of the resistance movement. The articles on this subject are regarded as being drawn from international media. Through an editorial process they were often scaled down and framed to fit with events in Denmark.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">
                                                <span>[32]</span>
                                            </a> A marked shift is noted in the articles from 1943 and onwards as the Jews are described as being marked for death. From 1944 words like gas chamber, gas truck or corpes factories were used consistently. In November 1944 pictures from the liberation of Majdanek (27 July 1944) showing Zyklon B cans, crematoria ovens, and piles of shoes were published in illegal papers.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">
                                                <span>[33]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>In addition, an article has examined the <em>depeschen </em>of the Danish head of legation in Berlin, Herluf Zahle. The aim of the article was to gain an insight into Zahle’s perception of National Socialism. Only in a few passages is the knowledge of the persecution against the Jews touched upon, but the findings do not add significant new insights compared to previous research. <a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">
                                                <span>[34]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>In 2015 the first collected work on the Danish Foreign Ministry’s knowledge of the persecution and murder of the Jews was published.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">
                                                <span>[35]</span>
                                            </a> Compared to previous research it includes all the archives of the legations in most European countries. It follows events relating to persecution of Jews on a European level from 1938 onwards as the Danish diplomats registered political debates and anti-Jewish measures in several European countries at this point in time. For example, the Danish chargé d’affaires in Lithuania, Carl Gustav Worsaae wrote in February 1938: “In the past years a wave of Antisemitism passes over Europe with Nazism as its primus motor… Moreover, Lithuania’s approximately 200.000 Jews live quite for themselves and are treated as second class citizens”.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">
                                                <span>[36]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>The level of knowledge in the Danish Foreign ministry was shown to be higher than previously estimated. Especially the files regarding individuals, either Danish Jews trapped in occupied Europe or relatives filing a missing person’s report, carried new and important information. This knowledge is placed into a ten phased model labelled stages of persecution and shows Denmark was aware of almost all stages in most countries.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">
                                                <span>[37]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>In the following I will briefly summarize this information and relate it to the examples chosen for publication in the EHRI digital edition.</p>
<p>In Western Europe the diplomats reported on all levels of persecution including concentration in transit camps and deportations.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">
                                                <span>[38]</span>
                                            </a> The earliest deportations were recorded in 1939 from the Protectorate to Buchenwald, while the report also included a variety of examples of anti-Jewish newly established in the Protectorate.</p>
<p>EHRI-DR-19391109-DK_EN</p>
<p>Due to the occupation of Denmark in April 1940 some events were downplayed in the official reports and took on a summary character. However, the references to official laws and specific local knowledge reveal how meticulously and thoroughly these were registered.</p>

<p>Some of these summaries do carry brief hints of larger scale events such as the report on Serbia where the final sentence reads “It can be added that as far as known there were practically no Jews in Serbia at the end of the year 1942”.</p>

<p>The missing persons’ reports show that Danish diplomats became aware of the destinations for deportation.</p>

<p>The fact that officials stated that they were unable to help deported persons is a prevalent characteristic in these files. These statements became increasingly adamant, possibly due to failed attempts at actually contacting the ghettoes or increasing knowledge of events.</p>
<p>Nazi-allied and -affiliated nations were reported on as well. Here all the phases of persecution were registered, and while the murder phase generally did not take place where Danish diplomats were located, they did report on pogroms in Romania.</p>

<p>The dispatches from these countries, and especially from Hungary contain more details on events.</p>

<p>This may be due to the fact that they were not occupied by Germany. A singular, but very interesting report from “Ostland” was also sent to the Danish Foreign Ministry, possibly because Danish businessmen had visited the area to seek out business opportunities.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">
                                                <span>[39]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>

<p>Revealing is also the document regarding Martha Hagen, a German-Jewish woman married to a Dane seeking to move to Denmark.</p>

<p>The document is a key document in understanding Danish refugee policy, but in relation to knowledge on the Holocaust attention should be drawn to the first paragraphs. These can be read as the clearest example of Danish knowledge of the murder of Jews. Clearly the sentence “Jews are considered enemies of the people and are to be removed, in the best of cases through isolation in ghettoes in the designated areas” makes one wonder what the worst case is – if the best case is ghettoization. (In early 1943 the Germans asked Denmark to bring home Jews of Danish nationality. Martha Hagen was among them and came to Denmark.)</p>
<p>It is estimated that sometime between the fall of 1942 and the early summer of 1943 Danish diplomats knew that Jews were being murdered. The documents from Sweden, presented as part of the EHRI diplomatic reports project, indicate this kind of information may have been obtained even earlier, as the information sharing between Denmark and Sweden was frequent and occurred on a very high level.</p>

<p>
                                            <span>From 1938 to 1943, Italian diplomats from all countries in which diplomatic representations existed provided detailed accounts of the persecution of Jews in their reporting area. While the reports contain comparatively few indications of mass murder, they provide ample information on anti-Semitism existing in the respective countries, anti-Jewish legislation, large-scaled confiscations labeled as "aryanizations", ghettoizations and deportations. Special attention was paid to the persecution of potential Italian citizens. Legal restrictions were usually described in more detail than deportations or even mass executions. However, it should be kept in mind that especially in the countries where the mass atrocities would largely take place, like Poland, the Baltic states or the Soviet Union, Italy had no (longer) legations onsite. Therefore, the ambassador in Berlin, former Propaganda Minister Dino Alfieri, relied heavily on secondhanded reports about the ghettoizations in Poland, the construction of the extermination camps, the deportations and the mass shootings.</span>

<p>
                                            <span>Reports on the persecution of Jews were handed down in the country files of the "Europe and Mediterranean Area"<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> department of the Directorate General for Political Affairs, which was divided into two sections since 1936. They were mostly sorted under the more general heading of "political conditions" ("Rapporti politici", position 1). In part, files on various countries were also compiled under heading 71 "Zionism" ("Sionismo").<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Diplomats at the Armistice and Peace Office (Ufficio Armistizio-Pace, Gabap) in the Cabinet of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Gabinetto del Ministro degli Esteri, Gabap) also dealt with the issue of the persecution of Jews. The Gabinetto had been established in June 1940 and was transformed at the end of 1941 into the General Directorate for the Affairs of Greece, Montenegro, Dalmatia, Slovenia, Croatia, Armistice, and Borders. In the Gabinetto holdings contain files on the persecution of Jews in Eastern and Central Europe, in particular on Croatia. As in the case of Greece, Italian officials were directly involved in the persecution of the Jews and did not only act as rapporteurs.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> </span>
                                        </p>
<p>
                                            <span>In addition, the Affari Generali (General Affairs) Department, Office IV (Affari riservati - Confidential Affairs) under Luigi Vidau dealt extensively with the "Jewish question". Filed under the item "S.E. 27/869/5", the files sorted by country contain reports on the years 1938 to 1943. However, there are also individual files from the time before the anti-Jewish legislation in Italy (1938). Division AG IV forwarded the reports it received to the relevant ministries or interested departments, such as the General Directorate of Public Security, i.e. the Italian State Police, and the General Directorate of Demography and Race, both within the Ministry of the Interior. Both General Directorates were responsible for the development and implementation of anti-Jewish measures.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> </span>
                                        </p>
<p>
                                            <span>From September 1943, some of the consulates represented the Repubblica Sociale Italiana (RSI), which had been established by Mussolin in northern and central Italy after the occupation of Italy by German troops. Files regarding the RSI are grouped together in a separate collection. With few exceptions, these reports were no longer concerned with Jews and their persecution.</span>
                                        </p>
<p>
                                            <span>Due to the extensive, but nevertheless incomplete tradition, it is ultimately impossible to clarify how many reports were actually written by Italian ambassadors, envoys, and consuls general and how high the proportion of these reports was, which found their way into the files of Political Affairs, the Gabap or the Section AG IV, all centrally loced in Rome. A part of the holdings can be suspected to have fallen victim to German troops shortly after the occupation of Rome: In mid-September 1943, Herbert Kappler, chief of the new external command of the Security Police and the SD, had three train wagons with 41 crates full of documents transferred to Berlin, where the files were lost. Among them were also files of the Cabap from the years 1932 to 1943, the Directorate for European and Mediterranean Affairs from the years 1936 to 1943 as well as telegrams from the years 1940 to 1943.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> </span>
                                        </p>
<p>
                                            <span>The files of the embassies themselves, like in the case oft the Embassy of Thessaloniki, have rarely survived. Since a large number of Italian Jews had taken residence there, it affected Italian interests and led to detailed reports are from the Consul General Zamboni in Thessaloniki. From the files of the legations of Prague (for the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia), Sofia (Bulgaria), Zagreb (Croatia), Bucharest (Romania), Belgrade (Serbia), Bratislav (Slovakia) and Budapest (Hungary), only fragments were recovered after the war. </span>
                                        </p>
<p>
                                            <span>Ruth Nattermann aptly summarized the fact that fascist Italy was not only the most important ally of the German Reich, but pursued as a dictatorship its own anti-Semitic policy since 1938:<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> The total exclusion of Jews from society, "aryanizations," internment of foreign and politically suspect Italian Jews from 1940, and forced labor from 1942 on occurred in Italy as well. Reports from other countries about similar persecutions could therefore serve as confirmation of the ‘practicability’ of ones own anti-Semitic policies. However, up until 1943, anti-Semitic policies in Italy were not aimed at the lives of Jews. Notably, Italian diplomats in France, Greece, and Croatia protected Jews from the German grip.<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> However, against the background of their own anti-Jewish laws, it seems that the envoys found it difficult to assess the impact and ruthlessness of "Jewish policies" practiced by other countries. The effects of anti-Semitic legislation and propaganda cannot be overlooked in the reports when they frequently refered to the "Jewish race" ("razza ebraica") and inlcuded anti-Semitic stereotypes. On the other hand, diplomats like Guelfo Zamboni and Giuseppe Castruccio in Greece or Roberto Venturini in Bulgaria, who demonstrably helped the local Jews and also expressed their sympathy for the persecuted in their reports. </span>

<p>
                                            <span>The large number of diplomatic reports dealing in detail with the persecution of Jews in Italy makes it clear that Italian diplomacy, but also Mussolini himself, who signed the reading of numerous documents with his "M", the State Police and the Demorazza, were aware of the extent of the National Socialist persecution of Jews. They did not share their knowledge with the persecuted. Therefore, the responsibility for active collaboration in the arrest of the Jews, especially since the end of November 1943, weighs all the more heavily.</span>

However, there are no diplomatic reports on the situation in the occupied Soviet Union and the Baltic states since the Moscow embassy had been vacated since in the beginning of the war. On the other hand, numerous reports on anti-Jewish legislation and deportations written in Western and Northern Europe are still available. <a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> </span>

<p>
                                            <span>The persecution of Jews in Poland, where there was no embassy at that time, was mentioned only sporadically in the files of the responsible ambassador in Berlin and was not evaluated as a crime. This is probably also due to the fact that in the war years Dino Alfieri, previously responsible as Minister of Propaganda for the vehement anti-Semitic propaganda in Italy, was Ambassador in Berlin. In contrast, the persecution of the Catholic Church, the discovery of the corpses in Katyn, took up a much larger space in the reports on "Political Affairs". Reports on the fate of the Jews in Poland can only be found in the description of the general political situation in connection with the increase in gang activity and corruption. The fact that the German Ambassador Dino Alfieri was aware of the situation in Poland is shown by his summary report for the Foreign Minister Ciano on 3 February 1943. In it he drew, even if mostly related to the Jews in the Reich, an overall view of the persecution of the European Jews and their fate. He first discussed the legislation and acts of violence up to 1938, the November pogroms and the subsequent incarceration of Jews in concentration camps, the "Aryanizations," the attempt to persuade Jews to emigrate on a massive scale, and the tightening of anti-Jewish legislation after the beginning of the war. Then he described the first deportations to Nisko, the larger plans for the deportation of Jews from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, from the Ostmark, from the annexed areas of Poznan and East Prussia and from the ‘Altreich’. He mentioned the ghettoization in Poland and the beginning of deportations, the wearing of the "Judensterns" and the resuming of deportations between autumn 1941 and spring 1943 to Theresienstadt and Upper Silesia. He estimated the number of deportees from the Greater German Reich at half a million and declared that he had no doubt about their fate or that of the Polish, Russian, Dutch and French Jews: The ghettos in the East would also be emptied, with only 53,000 Jews left from the Warsaw Ghetto, where 600,000 Jews had been imprisoned. Members of the embassy had also learned details from an SS man who had been involved in executions.</span>

<p>
                                            <span>A few months later, on 4 June 1943, Dino Alfieri also gave a report on the situation in the Generalgouvernement in a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The report came from the inspector of the Fasci in Germany and the Protectorate, P. Ruggeri L., who had made a short trip to Warsaw. He, too, was primarily concerned with war damage, the impoverishment of the population, the increase of resistance groups, the black market, corruption, and the establishment of a Polish-Russian army against Bolshevism. He presented the ghetto uprising as a fight against communist gangs, he did not report mass murder.</span>

<p>With regard to the Jews in Romania, individual documents from the legation in Bucharest have been handed down in the general files on "political affairs"; further reports can be found in the holdings of Section AG IV. The letters dealt with legal anti-Jewish measures, the definition of the "Jewish race", "Aryanizations", deportations to forced labour camps, the establishment of a ghetto in Chernivtsi, the pressure of the German ally to intensify anti-Jewish policy. There are also reports about the pogroms of Bucharest and Jassy. On 19 July 1941, for example, the envoy Renato Bova Scoppa referred to the pogrom in Iași (as a "Jewish-Communist revolt") to inform about the draconian anti-Jewish measures of Romanian troops in the reconquered areas of Bukovina and Bessarabia.</p>


<p>On September 23, 1942, Bova Scoppa also named the Romanian government's plans for the deportation of the Jews, which had arisen after German pressure. In fact, a deportation to Belzec was planned, but in the end it did not take place.</p>


<p>
                                            <span>The reports also mention the abductions to Transnistria. On 1 June 1943, the Consul General of Odessa, Maurilio Coppini, summarised the situation in Transnistria, occupied by Romanians, in a report for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, referring to the ghettos in Odessa and Balta and to the protests of the Nuncio and the Red Cross.</span>

He also addressed the public opinion on "Jewish policy" and "Aryanization" and finally stated that of the 40,000 Jews who had lived in Croatia, 6,000 had now been interned in concentration camps or were doing forced labor and the others had partly emigrated, but some should also be regarded as "missing". </span>

In fact, in August 1942, the first trains from the Tenje camp to the Auschwitz extermination camp were sent. Giustiniani also responded to German requests for the extradition of Jews from the Italian zone. At the same time, Mussolini agreed to the extradition of the Jews to the Croats at the request of the German envoy in Rome, Otto Fürst von Bismarck, although von Bismarck had expressly indicated that the extradition of several thousand persons would "practically lead to their dispersal and elimination.”<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> Ultimately, this extradition was driven back by an interplay of diplomats and military personnel, and the Jews were interned on the spot instead, which accounts for much of the file material.</span>

<p>When considering Japanese diplomatic reports relating to the persecution of Jews in wartime Europe, a number of factors must be taken into consideration: the Japanese diplomatic presence after the outbreak of war in 1939, the loss of wartime records at the end of the war, and particular concerns (or lack of) about Jews in Europe that influenced the content of Japanese reports and policy.</p>

                                            <strong>Japanese Diplomatic Establishments in Wartime Europe</strong>
                                        </p>
<p>Before the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939, Japan maintained diplomatic establishments in many European countries that consisted of embassies and consulates. However, after Nazi Germany’s <em>Anschluss</em> of Austria, annexation of Czechoslovakia and occupation of Poland and other parts of Europe during the war, Japan closed a number of embassies and consulates. This also happened after the Soviet annexation of Baltic states in 1940. Consequently, Japan’s diplomatic presence in eastern Europe where the Jews were persecuted and killed by the Nazis was reduced considerably.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the fate of as well as attitudes towards the Jewish population in countries ally to or occupied by Germany, were mentioned in reports to Tokyo. Compared to other reports in this edition, however, the references towards the situation of Jews in occupied or allied countries are oftentimes significantly shorter.</p>


<p>An exception to these rather short and oftentimes vague renderings, is the report “Conditions in German-occupied Former Polish Territory”. Produced in April 1941 and kept at the Diplomatic Record Office, Tokyo, the report was the third one in a series. No information, however, is available about the first two.</p>
<p>Its author is a junior Japanese diplomat named Maruo Itaru. Born in 1914, he qualified for the foreign service in 1935 and was immediately assigned to study in Warsaw. In July 1937 Maru was appointed as a diplomatic clerk (shokisei) in the Japanese embassy in Warsaw. After the German invasion of Poland, Maruo was re-assigned to Germany in November 1939. Later in the war he served in the Japanese Consulate in Hamburg. He returned to Japan after the war.</p>
<p>Maruo visited Warsaw from 7-19 January 1941. Since he had been in Poland for over four years for study and work before his departure for Germany in late 1939, it is likely that he had cultivated local contacts. He apparently based his report on the information provided by some of those contacts, including underground agents. It is not clear whether Maruo also wrote the other two reports.</p>
<p>The 157-page report is divided into five parts, which are then further divided into sub-sections. Usual for an official document produced by Germany’s close ally, the report was highly critically of Germany’s policy of human and material destruction in occupied Poland against the Jews and Poles. The harshest criticism was about Nazi Germany’s policies of cultural suppression and forced labor.</p>

                                            <strong>Japan’s Official Policy toward Jews in Wartime Europe</strong>
                                        </p>
<p>Japanese attitude toward the Jews has received considerable attention in recent years. Apart from those on Japanese diplomat Sugihara Chiune who issued thousands of transit visas to Jewish refugees while serving as Acting Consul in Kaunas, Lithuania, a few publications focused on formulation of official policies toward the Jews. Two important factors were at play: the influx of Jewish refugees from Europe after 1938 as well as Japan’s alliance with Germany (first in Anti-Comintern Pact in 1936, Tripartite Pact in 1940).<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">
                                                <span>[4]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>


<p>After Japan invaded northeastern China (Manchuria) in 1931 and subsequently withdrew from the League of Nations, a few Japanese advocated working with Jews in Europe and Asia. Businessmen like Ayukawa Yoshisuke proposed inviting Anglo-American Jews to invest in Japanese-controlled Manchukuo, while several Japanese military officers explored the scheme of inducing Jewish refugees from Europe to settle in Japanese-controlled area, with the financial assistance from the Jewish diaspora in the United States and Britain. These policies were intended to help finance Japan’s industrialization plan and to transform its prairah status. Against this background, the Japanese Cabinet adopted an official policy toward Jews at the end of 1938, claiming Jews would be treated without discrimination.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">
                                                <span>[5]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>After the German invasion of Poland, an increasingly large number of Jews sought to escape from Nazi persecution in Europe and to seek safe haven elsewhere. Many sought to transit through Manchukuo or Japan Proper to reach Shanghai or a third country.</p>

<p>Alarmed by the influx of Jewish refugees, the Japanese government adopted the “Policy on the Entry of Jewish Refugees” in October 1939,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">
                                                <span>[6]</span>
                                            </a> stipulating that only those with visas to third countries <em>and</em> sufficient funds could obtain transit visa through Japan. Sugihara Chiune issued transit visas to Jewish refugees in violation of this official policy, while a few other Japanese diplomats expressed dismay at the new restriction. The signing of the Axis Alliance signaled the sidelining of the faction inside the government in favoring of making use of Jews. The German invasion of the Soviet Union in mid-1941 effectively removed the issue of Jewish refugees coming from Europe. Finally, after its declaration of war against the United States and Britain in December 1941, Japanese Government revised its policy toward Jews because the incentive of inducing (Anglo-American) Jews to invest in Japanese-occupied Asia and cultivating their goodwill no longer existed. Nevertheless, it had to deal with the presence of Jews in a vast area now under its control.</p>
<p>Existent Japanese diplomatic documents show that beginning from the earlier 1930s, the Japanese Government engaged in extensive discussion concerning Jews in Europe and elsewhere. Many of these documents are collected in a 13-volumn set within the Documents on Issue of Nationalities that is devoted to the Jews.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">
                                                <span>[7]</span>
                                            </a> The majority of the documents date before the German invasion of USSR. Apart from this set, very rarely is the Jewish issue mentioned in the scarce Japanese diplomatic reports from wartime Europe that have survived.</p>
<p>In many of Japanese diplomatic establishments army and navy attaches gathered information and dispatched reports, not to the Foreign Ministry, but to army and navy general staff. In addition, Japan established special diplomatic and military missions in Berlin and Rome after the signing of the Axis Alliance in 1940. Most of their records seem to have been lost. A cursory examination of the Allied intercepts reveals that they are primarily with military matters. Although further research is needed.</p>

<p>
                                            <strong>The Loss of Wartime Official Japanese Sources</strong>
                                        </p>
<p>Compared with its Axis ally Germany, wartime destruction of Japanese official documents was extensive. In addition to those lost due to aerial bombing and fire, when Japan finally decided to surrender in mid-August 1945, it ordered the destruction of sensitive documents. It had considerable success as the first Allied forces did not set foot on Japanese home islands until nearly two weeks after the war’s end. The destruction of military documents was particularly extensive. Many of Japanese Foreign Ministry (MOFA) documents did survive, however. Most of them are currently open to the public at the MOFA’s Diplomatic Record Office. Outside Japan, a very small number of documents were recovered from Japanese embassies in Vienna (consulate after 1937), Berlin and its Consulate General in Hamburg.</p>
<p>During the war, the Allies conducted extensive signal intelligence against the Axis powers. They succeeded in capturing a large portion of the diplomatic and military communications between Tokyo and its overseas missions. Although some of the documents destroyed during and at the end of war were among the intercepted, the Allies gave highest priority to communications relating to military operations. Those Japanese communications of a non-military nature, especially dispatched outside Germany, were of the lowest priority and were often un-translated. After the war, all the intercepted originals were destroyed. Among those translated, such as the MAGIC intercepts of Japanese diplomatic messages, while the issues of Jews were mentioned rather frequently, they reported nothing on the concentration camps or massacres.

<p>When the prominent American diplomat and historian George F. Kennan published his memoirs from the interwar years in 1967, he dedicated a separate chapter to his term of office as Secretary of the Legation in Prague. Kennan had arrived in the Czechoslovakian capital at the end of September 1938, immediately before the Munich Agreement, and was to remain there until the beginning of the Second World War on September 1, 1939. When the U.S. State Department officially closed the Legation in March 1939, after the German occupation of the remainder of Czechoslovakia, Kennan stayed behind to report on further developments of the country. “In the end, I was left as practically the only Western political observer regularly residing in what remained of Czechoslovakia. The fare of a small nation already occupied and suppressed by the Germans was not of great interest to the metropolitan dailies of the Western countries. Czechoslovakia had gone down the drain, and that was that. But it was not uninteresting for me. Horrified but fascinated by what was taking place before my eyes, I poured forth a stream of letters and reports to the government. Not more than five people, I suppose, ever read them in Washington. […] Almost everything that I had previously experienced was useful to me in observing and in trying to understand the drama of the disintegration of the initial Czechoslovakia that was now taking place before my eyes. With knowledge of Russian, it was not too difficult to learn enough of the Czech, Slovak, and Ruthenian tongues to read the papers and to carry on conversations of sorts with people who spoke nothing else. Long years of residence in Germany and Austria meant that the Germans, who were now the other leading part of this drama, were no mystery to me. Service in Vienna, in particular, had given me some idea of the old Central Europe out of which the state Czechoslovakia had emerged.”<a href="#_ftn1">
                                                <span>[1]</span>

                                        </p>
<p>Kennan's memories of his time in Prague shed light on the prerequisites, opportunities,and limits of American diplomatic reporting from the Central and Eastern European successor states of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire: If a diplomat possessed knowledge of foreign languages and was familiar with the history and culture of the country, if he was curious and interested in political and social developments, and was granted freedom from administrative duties, he could produce reports at a high level of reflection and transcend the forwarding of official documents and press clippings. However, this did not guarantee that these reports were widely received in Washington and influenced general American policies of the interwar years.</p>


<p>These policies were guided by manifold political and economic aspects and, of course, domestic considerations. After the failure of the League of Nations treaty in the U.S. Senate in 1919, the United States remained politically and economically present on the international stage and steered a middle course between detachment and involvement – with growing isolationist tendencies in the 1930s. The United States tried to promote economic exchange and the peaceful resolution of conflicts through bilateral treaties and guarantees. In Europe, they advocated for pragmatic solutions of political problems in the interest of political and economic stability but abstained from collective security agreements.</p>
<p>With regard to the pressure on ethnic or religious minorities in Europe, the American position remained unchanged throughout the 1920s and much of the 1930s. Members of Congress, representatives of interest groups, and private American citizens who encouraged the President or the State Department to be more active in this regard received the standard answer, “that this Government is not in a position to make representations to a foreign Government with respect to conditions which do not directly affect American citizens or interests.“<a href="#_ftn1">
                                                <span>[2]</span>
                                            </a> Despite sometimes emotional reports from American diplomats on the fate of the Jews in the states of Central and Eastern Europe and, after 1933, in the German Reich, the restrictive American immigration rules for refugees from Europe remained in place until the end of the Second World War.<a href="#_ftn2">
                                                <span>[3]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>Soon after the founding of the United States in the late 18th century, the new state established diplomatic missions and the first consulates abroad. In the 19th century, the Foreign Service expanded, but many of the most important posts were given to favorites of the President regardless of qualification and local requirements. Only in 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt began to professionalize the Foreign Service, and the Rogers Act of 1924 unified diplomatic and consular career paths. But high-ranking diplomatic posts at the embassies continued to be filled by political appointees and only consulates were on principle being filled by career officials. Embassies and legations cultivated political relations, whereas the consulates assisted compatriots in distress, represented American economic interests and – since the introduction of visa requirements and immigration quotas for foreigners – examined visa applications.<a href="#_ftn3">
                                                <span>[4]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>As a result of the professionalization process, the network of U.S. consulates in many countries had shrunk significantly. While in Germany, during the peace years of the “Third Reich,” in addition to the Embassy and the Consulate General in Berlin, there were consulates at nine other locations, in the Central and Eastern European countries the United States was represented only by embassies or legations and a consulate in the capitals.</p>
<p>With Romania, diplomatic relations had been established in 1880 already, shortly after the Berlin congress of 1878 and the founding of an independent state. Bulgaria followed in 1911. After the First World War, between 1919 and 1922, American diplomatic missions opened in the newly formed states of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary.<a href="#_ftn4">
                                                <span>[5]</span>
                                            </a> American consulates had existed in all the states since the 1880s already, with the exception of Bulgaria where the first American consul general was not appointed before 1915. The position of consul Benjamin F. Peixotto, a lawyer and former president of the American B’nai B’rith, in Bucharest was a peculiarity of American foreign representation because it was created in 1870 on Peixotto’s own initiative – explicitly to help the Romanian Jews.<a href="#_ftn5">
                                                <span>[6]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>The State Department in Washington welcomed and occasionally explicitly demanded political reporting from both its embassies and consulates. All correspondence with Foreign Service posts since 1910 was archived with the help of a decimal system, which assigned a signature to each document that identified the country and subject and then ranged it chronologically. Reports from embassies and consulates are usually contained in several sub-series, but the central series for political reporting on internal affairs, including aspects of ethnic and religious minorities, is the “Internal Affairs” series for each country. These series are available on microfilm for the interwar and war period for all countries.<a href="#_ftn6">
                                                <span>[7]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>
<p>The documents provide valuable insights into the American perception of political and social developments in the respective countries, but since the United States did not have any consulates outside the capitals which could have contributed regional and local perspectives on a regular basis, the reports from Central and Eastern Europe focus primarily on national developments, new legislation, comments by members of the governments and other elites, or information derived from the major newspapers. With few exceptions, they were written or at least approved by the ambassadors.</p>
<p>Among the representatives of the United States in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1930s and early 1940s, none of them had George Kennan's linguistic and regional geographic background.<a href="#_ftn7">
                                                <span>[8]</span>
                                            </a> Kennan had learned German as a young child. As a Foreign Service officer, he had followed a special training program in the Russian language, history, and politics at the University of Berlin’s Oriental Institute. From 1931 to 1933 he was stationed at the American Legation in Riga, Latvia, which was focused on political reporting on the Soviet Union,<a href="#_ftn8">
                                                <span>[9]</span>
                                            </a> and in 1933 he accompanied the first American ambassador to Moscow.</p>
<p>When Kennan arrived in Prague in 1938, his superior was the Foreign Service career official Wilbur J. Carr (1870-1942). Carr had joined the State Department in 1892, took charge of the consular service in 1909 and guided the reform process to the Rogers Act of 1924. He served as Assistant Secretary of State from 1924 to 1937, before receiving his first and only foreign assignment by becoming ambassador to Czechoslovakia in July 1937. After the closure of the Prague Embassy, he returned to the United States in April 1939.<a href="#_ftn9">

<p>In Poland Anthony J. Drexel Biddle Jr. (1896-1961) took over the ambassador post from John C. Cudahy (1887-1943) in June 1937. Cudahy had received his first appointment as a diplomat in Warsaw in 1933, and his successor Drexel Biddle did not have much Foreign Service experience either. Drexel Biddle was born into a rich family in Pennsylvania and, after serving in the military during the First World War, had tried his hand in the business world. He owed his appointment to the ambassadorship in Norway in 1935 to his financial support of the Democratic Party. He transferred to Poland in June 1937, witnessed the German invasion in September 1939 and fled the country with the embassy staff via Romania and France. From March 1941 to 1943 he continued as U.S. ambassador to the Polish, Czechoslovakian and several other governments in exile in London.<a href="#_ftn10">

<p>The American Legation in Hungary was headed from August 1, 1933, to March 17, 1941, by John Flournoy Montgomery (1878-1954). Montgomery was from Missouri and had established himself as a successful businessman in the dairy industry. Just like Drexel Biddle, he was rewarded for his generous support during the election campaigns for the Democratic Party. The position in Budapest remained Montgomery’s first and only diplomatic post. In March 1941 he was succeeded by Herbert C. Pell Jr. (1884-1961), who had been an influential politician of the Democratic Party in New York in the 1920s and 1930s and Vice Chairman of the Democratic National Campaign Committee for the re-election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. Pell had been rewarded for his services with the position of American Envoy to Portugal in 1937. After his transfer to Hungary, he served in Budapest until Hungary declared war on the United States on December 13, 1941.<a href="#_ftn11">

<p>In Romania, the career official Leland B. Harrison (1883-1951) took up the Bucharest post in July 1935. Harrison had joined the U.S. Foreign Service after graduating from Harvard law school. He had been Assistant Secretary of State in the State Department since 1922 and then served as Minister to Sweden and Uruguay. In October 1937, he was succeeded by Franklin Mott Gunther (1885-1941), a career official, who headed the Legation until the Romanian declaration of war on December 12, 1941. Gunther had previously held only one foreign post in Egypt at the end of the 1920s.<a href="#_ftn12">
                                                <span>[13]</span>

                                        </p>
<p>The American Legation in Bulgaria was officiated from 1937 until July 1939 by the career diplomat Ray Atherton (1883-1960), who, similar to Gunther, previously had held only one short foreign appointment as Chargé d’Affairs in Greece (1923/24). In April 1940, he was succeeded by George H. Earle III (1890-1974), a wealthy Pennsylvania businessman who had supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 election campaign and had been rewarded with the position of American Minister to Austria in 1933-1934. From 1935 to 1937, he served as Governor of Pennsylvania, ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1938, and then served as American Minister to Bulgaria from 1940 until the Bulgarian declaration of war on December 13, 1941.<a href="#_ftn13">

                                        </p>
<p>Additional reports with special emphasis on the situation of the Jews included in the selection from the State Department files were written by Embassy Counselor North Winship (1885-1968) from Warsaw, Consul General Irving N. Linnell (1881-1954) from Prague and the Secretary of the Legation in Bucharest, Frederick P. Hibbard (1885-?).</p>


<p>After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and Poland and the closure of the Embassies, some reports on developments in these countries were submitted from the American Embassy in Berlin, and after the declaration of war between Germany and the United States on December 11, 1941, reports on the Central and Eastern European countries were submitted by the American Embassies in Istanbul and Bern.</p>


<p>Many of the United States Envoys, Ministers and Ambassadors were from the same age group, born in the 1870s and 1880s, and experienced in the business world and American politics. By appointing trusted friends as ambassadors to the states of Central and Eastern Europe, President Franklin D. Roosevelt at least partly circumvented the bureaucracy of the State Department. What the “political appointees” may have lacked in familiarity with international relations or the political and social situation on-site, they made up for with their enthusiasm to engage in social activities, build networks and observe and report as meticulously as possible. They were hampered, however, by their lack of knowledge of the national languages, which in turn fostered proximity to polyglot local elites. The lingering glamor of the bygone world of old Europe left its mark, most notably in the case of Montgomery and – to a lesser extent – on his predecessor Herbert Pell in Budapest. Montgomery developed a close relationship with the Hungarian regent Admiral Miklós Horthy and actively tried to promote a positive image of Hungary and its government in the United States.<a href="#_ftn1">

<p>In the reporting on anti-Semitism and the persecution of Jews, there is no substantial difference between career officials and political appointees.<a href="#_ftn1">
                                                <span>[16]</span>
                                            </a> From all five countries, a steady stream of detailed reports and appraisals reached the State Department – and in many cases President Roosevelt – as long as this was possible under wartime conditions: from Czechoslovakia and Poland until the fall of 1939, from Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary until the end of 1941. State or legislative measures, public events, demonstrations and acts of violence, reports in the local press and background information based on personal contacts up to the respective heads of state, journalists, but also to leading representatives of Jewish organizations, were presented in detail and often within hours after the events took place.</p>

<p>Possible or – in the case of Montgomery in Budapest proven – personal anti-Semitic attitudes are not reflected in the reports, but almost all of the diplomats did not question the existence of a „Jewish problem“ in Central and Eastern Europe. Here they adopted language patterns of the governments and other official institutions of their host countries. The diplomats reported neutrally on quotas for Jews at the universities, in the civil service or the free professions, and they did not question the officially propagated increased emigration as the solution of the „Jewish problem.“</p>

<p>However, any kind of physical violence was criticized. In January 1941, Franklin Gunther closed his horrifying description of a massacre in the slaughterhouse of Bucharest with the outcry that it “makes one sick at heart to be accredited to a country where such things can happen.“<a href="#_ftn1">
                                                <span>[17]</span>
                                            </a>
                                        </p>

<p>The American diplomats assigned a certain significance to the German role model for the respective national anti-Semitic forces, especially in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>The measures taken after 1933 in the Reich – from the first boycotts of Jewish businesses and the exclusion of Jewish university students and civil servants to the Nuremberg racial laws of 1935, to the November pogrom of 1938, and the expulsion and ghettoization of Jews during wartime – showcased lines of action, which at different times and in various intensities were adopted in Central and Eastern Europe as well. However, the reports made clear that the difference in timing and intensity was determined by domestic political factors: the instrumentalization of hatred of Jews in economic and military crises, anti-Semitism as a welcomed link between otherwise opposing political forces, envy of actual or assumed economic successes and the influence of Jews in public life, as well as economic opportunities for non-Jews to enrich themselves on Jewish property.</p>

<p>The nationalistic dimensions of anti-minority policies and long-term ideals of ethnically homogenous nation-states were less clearly recognized by the diplomats. Still, assurances by the respective governments, for example in Romania in 1941, that they deplored acts of anti-Semitic violence in their countries, the diplomats found noncredible.</p>

<p>The attitudes of the respective populations were analyzed less intensively than in the American reports from the „Third Reich,“ but the existence of a sort of universal anti-Semitism in the Central and Eastern European countries was usually disputed: The diplomats emphasized that there were certain social classes or population groups in certain regions, which were also responsible for increasing acts of violence during the early war years.</p>

<p>Since all American diplomats had to leave their posts at the end of 1941, the deportation of Jews in collaboration with the Germans in the second half of the war and the political and public reaction to them are not recorded in first-hand reports.</p>
<p>The American diplomats described and analyzed in their reports from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria anti-Semitic attitudes and policies of their host countries but respected diplomatic protocol and the official U.S. directive of non-intervention in internal affairs and abstained from policy recommendations for the State Department. Based on a variety of sources including personal observations, the reports sketch an increasingly bleak picture of Jewish life in Central and Eastern Europe without foreseeing the horrors of the second half of the Second World War.</p>
