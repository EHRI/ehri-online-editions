The name <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449" type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName>, the model camp of the Nazis, did not imply horror.

The barracks of the fortress formerly used for the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004851">Austrian Military</orgName> and for Political <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoners</term> – among them Principe who assassinated the Archduke <persName ref="#ehri_et_franz_ferdinand_of_austria">Franz Ferdinand</persName> of <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2782113/republic-of-austria.html">Austria</placeName> in <date when="1914">1914</date> and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">died</term> in the damp dungeons of <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449" type="ghetto">Terezin</placeName> – and the small houses of the town were all occupied by Jews; only the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-765" type="subject">church</term> was excluded and was locked up.</p>
					<p>These barracks and houses were situated in the so-called Grosse Festung (Big Fortress), the ghetto proper, a minor part of which was reserved for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term>. There, in the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449" type="ghetto">Sudeten Kaserne</placeName>, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term> kept the files of their records. The big fortress is surrounded by
						walls, the gates of which were guarded by <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004772">Czech police</orgName>. Though it was not easy to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">escape</term> from that
						prison town it was not impossible, provided the people who dared the attempt spoke the vernacular. Some <term ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_czechs" type="subject">Czech</term> Jews while on work outside the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545" type="subject">ghetto</term> succeeded in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">fleeing</term>.

					<p>On the far side of the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2933206/eger.html">Eger</placeName> lies the small fortress (<placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-759" type="camp">Kleine Festung</placeName>), a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">concentration camp</term> for people from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/8505031/czechoslovakia.html">Czecho-Slovakia</placeName> and <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449" type="camp">Theresienstadt</placeName>.

					<p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">accommodation</term> of the Grosse Festung was enlarged by some wooden huts, built by the Jewish <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483" type="subject">inmates</term>. <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">Men</term> and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">women</term> lived <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-667" type="subject">separated</term> from each other in the barracks. Some were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term>'s quarters, others <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject">women</term>'s quarters. <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">Family</term> life was impossible, but people could see each other after day's <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> was done.</p>
					<p>The space <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1048" type="subject">allotted</term> to each person was not more than about 4 ft. 5 ins. just enough to lie down, but in this small <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831" type="subject">space</term> one was supposed to eat, wash and sleep, and to live. Bedsteads, or rather wooden bunks, were placed in three tiers. People slept on straw-filled sacks, straw mattresses – rugs were not provided. Everybody had to provide a rug or cover for
						himself. All the barracks were bug-infested.</p>
					<p>In the small private houses, which might more correctly be called slum quarters, no furniture was left, and the same small space was detailed to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483" type="subject">inmates</term>.</p>
					<p>We had dim electric light. <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-295" type="subject">Sanitation</term> was most primitive.</p>
					<p>For about 5,000 people, the officials of the administration and some persons who, on <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-633" type="subject">German orders</term>, had to receive preferential treatment, a little more space – about 5 ft. X 5 ft. – was

Single beds were placed in the huts that were being shown. The day before the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-419">Commission</orgName> arrived we

All the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">sick</term>, the war invalids and old people were put into houses which would not be shown to the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-419">Commission</orgName>. For the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">children</term> a kindergarten was arranged in a great hurry. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject">children</term> were instructed that when the Commandant entered with the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-419">Commission</orgName>, they must run to meet him and shout <q>Good-day Uncle <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000318">Rahm</persName>, are you coming to play with us?</q> and as the party left they were to say <q>When are you coming to see us again, Uncle <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000318">Rahm</persName>?</q> The <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-419">Commission</orgName> was tricked. Everyone ought to have been able to scent that the painting was fresh,
						that the furniture in our huts had been lately put in and had not been used. And our eyes ought to have told them the rest – but instead they thought that we were in good spirits and full of hope.</p>

					<p>The whole character of the town was changed by this embellishment by order. Recreation grounds were laid out with large flower-beds, a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-691" type="subject">music</term> tent where the town band gave concert every
						afternoon was built, a kindergarten with cradles, a slide and a see-saw was established, as well as a laundry. Even a restaurant was opened where one could eat one's meals on one's <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-834" type="subject">ration</term>

					<p>In a word, a Potemkin village was put before the eyes of the foreign visitors. Dr. <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/terezin-victims-person-iti-342720" type="victim">Epstein</persName> had to make an exaggerated report about the favourable <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831" type="subject">conditions</term> in <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449" type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName> to the delegation.

In <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449" type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName> your neighbour was not exactly your friend, but at least a neutral person.

					<p>Humanity True to Nazi Pattern. Such was life in the show <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567" type="subject">camp</term> the Nazis had deliberately organised to provide an alibi for themselves. Was it not an example of humanity to set up a

					<p>Humane indeed, if you call it humane to deprive decent, innocent people arbitrarily of their freedom, to strip them of everything but the clothes they had on, to feed them on a diet which enables only the strong to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-561" type="subject">survive</term>, to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-667" type="subject">isolate</term> ordinary people and some who had won world fame, completely from the outer

					<p>All the time I could not help imagining that we were interred in a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-539" type="subject">mass grave</term> in which people were dancing.

A sister who was <q>only</q> 64 years of age had had to go first, leaving her brothers or sisters behind her, who were fortunate enough to be in their seventies.

					<!--<p>-8-</p>-->
					<p>trick was obvious. By this bait the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">SS</orgName> wanted to entice our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject">wives</term> to join us without arousing any suspicion

						<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522" type="subject">train</term> they employed diabolical methods like these to deceive people about their fate in order to avoid irritation and disturbances in the <q>model <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567" type="subject">camp</term></q>. Perhaps another <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-996" type="subject">commission</term> might arrive in <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449" type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName> and notice the change in the mental atmosphere of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483" type="subject">inmates</term>. The same method
						was employed on many occasions all over the eastern <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567" type="subject">camps</term>. That accounts for the numerous messages relatives received describing favourable conditions in the east.</p>
					<p>The Hangman. After a journey of three days and two nights the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522" type="subject">train</term> arrived at a railway siding on <date when="1944-09-29">29th September 1944</date>. It was dark, about 9 p.m., but though
						we could not see the name of the station we guessed we were in the notorious <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-0" type="camp">Oswiecim (Auschwitz) camp</placeName>. We were dragged out of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522" type="subject">wagons</term> by <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoners</term> and not allowed to take our luggage with us. It was looted afterwards, and even
						the small rations we had were stolen by the old <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567" type="subject">camp</term>
						<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483" type="subject">inmates</term>.</p>
					<p>We were formed into files and had to pass an <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">SS</orgName> officer – most probably an <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">SS</orgName>
						<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-287" type="subject">doctor</term>. He sat on a chair, three yards away from us, with legs outstretched in a half ??<note place="bottom">Text unclear</note> position, almost motionless. The only part of his body
						which he moved was the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-411" type="subject">thumb</term> of his right hand. With this he pointed either to the left or to the right as a man stood in front of him. He did not utter a single word. We had been ordered
						to answer three questions: What age, what occupation, in what state of health. I answered: 27 – metal worker – fit. The <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">SS</orgName> officer thumbed me to the right.</p>
					<p>After this <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-411" type="subject">sorting</term> of human beings 1600 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> found themselves on the right, 900 on the left. Not
						everybody had declared himself fit. Was this not after all a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">working</term> detachment? The very word seemed to indicate that there were different kinds of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term> to do, heavy for younger people, and lighter work for elderly <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term>. Thus some of the parded
							<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> may have explained that they were suffering from complaints preventing them from doing too heavy <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>. Others gave themselves away by their grey hair, though the whole detachment consisted of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1076" type="subject">military</term> age. This latter fact explains why so <q>few</q> were directed to the left. As I heard afterwards the usual percentage of people <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-411" type="subject">selected</term> for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">annihilation</term> was 85/90%.</p>
					<p>While queuing in front of our hangman we saw flames arising from the chimneys of several buildings, and were told by the old timers that these housed the central heating plants of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567" type="subject">camp</term>.</p>
					<p>During the whole night we had to stand in a stable. Then we had to strip and to give up everything, including our wedding rings, except our belts, spectacles and shoes. We were next led into a bath-house where our heads were shaved and we had to take a shower. We, i.e. the
						1600 fortunate ones.</p>
					<p><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-529" type="subject">Extermination</term>. The other party, the 900 doomed <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term>, had undergone the same procedure of waiting,
						stripping and giving up their belongings. They too were led into a bath-house, but instead of steam and water, poison <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-534" type="subject">gas</term> was infiltrated into that <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-499" type="subject">chamber</term>. All our 900 comrades, with some of whom we had shared the times of anxiety and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-641" type="subject">persecution</term>
						in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2750405/kingdom-of-the-netherlands.html">Holland</placeName>, and later the months of respite, hope and again anxiety in <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-449" type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName>, met their end in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-499" type="subject">death chambers</term> of <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-0" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName> on the
						morning of the <date when="1944-09-30">30th Sept. 1944</date>. They had, as one of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1428" type="subject">Jewish camp doctors</term> told me later, not known up to the last moment, what was in store for them.</p>
					<p>Before they entered the gate of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">death</term> the fate of three of the doomed men changed at the very last moment. Some <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-429">SS</orgName>
						<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> passing that batch of people being led to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-499" type="subject">gas chambers</term> picked out three <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term>, maybe because they seemed still fit for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject">work</term>. One of the three thus saved a few minutes before
							<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">annihilation</term> was <persName ref="#ehri_et_spitz">Spitz</persName>, a civil engineer of about 50.

						<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-480" type="subject">Guards of the camp</term> had left their posts, when I was pushed out of the gates by the crowd of fellow-<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-650" type="subject">prisoners</term>.

For some days and nights we remained in the
						forest near <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-7" type="camp">Blechhammer</placeName> where we heard the roar of the approaching battle. We were happy. There were machine-gun bullets and shell-fire, but we did not feel frightened. Was this only
						due to our lack of fighting experience? In part it might have been so because we were surprised when we noticed that all <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-124" type="subject">civilians</term> around us had suddenly disappeared.</p>
					<pb facs="EHRI-ET-YV3549264_12.jpg" n="12"/>
					<!--<p>-11-</p>-->
					<p>It took us some time to realise that these <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-124" type="subject">people</term> had simply thrown themselves down on the ground, in order to take cover, and we followed, of course, their example. But I think there was
						another reason for our standing upright while shells and bullets whistled around us. It was impersonal <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">death</term> which we here encountered for the first time. The bullets and shells were not
						meant to end just our lives. <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">Death</term>, which had been at our heels from the first day of our falling into the hands of the Nazis, death in <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-0" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName>, was quite a different companion. In <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-0" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName> we were singled out, we <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-332" type="subject">Jews</term>, defenseless, completely at the mercy of the merciless. <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">Death</term> was lurking at every corner ready
						to force us into his suffocating grip. At times we even felt a desire to surrender to this greedy companion to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">escape</term> at least the daily, nay hourly, threat that he might strike us down.
						In <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-0" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName> we had to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-250" type="subject">resist</term> the temptation to throw ourselves against the seductive
						electric wire and thus end our suspense. In the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-7" type="camp">Blechhammer</placeName> Forest, where only impersonal <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">death</term> threatened, we shared a danger common to all and felt free and relieved even when we realised that the shells and bullets might end our <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">escape</term> into life.</p>
