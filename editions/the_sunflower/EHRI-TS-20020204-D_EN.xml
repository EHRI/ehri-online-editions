Determining that by age ten children’s minds could be turned from play to politics, the regime inducted nearly all German juveniles between ages of ten and eighteen into its state-run organization.

<p>Each year, as part of our Holocaust unit of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-878" type="subject">study</term>, we ask <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-916" type="subject">students</term> to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-683" type="subject">read </term>The Sunflower. The second part of the assignment is for them to write what they would have done in your “shoes”.</p>
<p>I thought you might be interested in what 13 year olds today had to say.</p>

   <p>Dear Ms. <persName ref="#EHRI-TS-20020204-D_4">R.</persName> [name anonymised],</p>
   <p>Thank you very much for sending me your students’ papers about The Sunflower – and, above all, for having asked them to read my book and to think about the issues it raises. I am indeed interested in what young people (13 year olds, in your case) have to say on the subject of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">guilt </term>and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term>, but I must apologize to you and your students for not replying sooner. Because of my advanced age, I only spend a few hours in the office each day, and since I do try to read all of the many personal responses to The Sunflower I receive, it sometimes takes some time before I can reply. I hope for your understanding.</p>
<p>Dear young friends,</p>
<p>I was pleased to hear that you have read my book, The Sunflower, and given thought to the behavior of the dying <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1097" type="subject">soldier</term> and my reaction to him. I believe that after thinking about how you would act in such a situation, you will no longer be able to regard the Holocaust as just something that happened in the past and which really has nothing to do with you.</p>
<p>There is always the danger that something similar to the Holocaust can happen again – when people become hateful and fanatic enough and when they let themselves be convinced to do things that their consciences tells them</p>
   <pb n="3" facs="EHRI-TS-20020204-D_03.jpg"/>
<p>is wrong. In the end, however, each individual carries the responsibility for his own actions, as the soldier realized on his death bed. His sense of guilt was almost too much for him to bear – so he wanted me to take some of it away from him. But how could I? Those he <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">killed</term> were irrevocably dead. He simply had to live – and die – with the knowledge that what he had done could not be made undone. Nothing I could say or do would change that.</p>
<p>My response to the dying soldier would be no different today – and I am now 93 years old – than it was then. How could I forgive something that was done to someone else; I cannot, and could not, forgive on behalf of the other <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-132" type="subject">victims</term>. Just as I do not believe in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">collective blame</term> I also do not believe in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">collective pardon</term>. The issue of responsibility and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846">forgiveness</term> can only be dealt with individually.</p>
   <p>At the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1130">trials</term> of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120">Nazi criminals</term> after the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-132" type="subject">war</term>, I seldom came upon <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS-men</term> who admitted to their crimes – much less regretted them. They usually tried to play down their own part in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">murders</term> or in other crimes. Many claimed that they had only been “acting on orders.”</p>
   <p>I thank each and every one of you for taking the time to think about all of this and for writing down your thoughts and sharing them with me. Your responses are very valuable to me and I am saving them all in a big “Sunflower-file”. I hope that you will keep up your interest in what happened to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jewish</term> people in the past, because it is important to keep the memory of the innocent <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-132">victims</term> alive and, by learning the lessons of the past, to help prevent a repetition of our tragedy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon Wiesenthal</persName></p>
<p>Dear Mr. <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Wiesenthal</persName>,</p>
   <p>It must have been a hard decision not to forgive the dying <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS man</term> . I would have done the same thing you did, because the only people who can <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgive</term> him were the people he killed. Also I think that if he wasn’t on his death bed he would have continued to kill more <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">Jews</term>. The thing I would have done differently would be to tell him why I couldn’t forgive him, because it might have given him some satisfaction to get it all out, and by listening you helped him. I think he was selfish because he killed a lot of people and when the things he did caught up with him he felt like he was being persecuted and not the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">Jews</term>. He is just regretting what he did because it ended up killing him. The statement, “What comes around goes around”, is really proven true in this book. Another thing I would have done differently is when you went to talk to <persName ref="#ehri_ts_karl_sunflower">Karl</persName>’s mom you should have told her the truth instead of letting her believe the wrong thing. What’s done is done and you can’t change it, and you may believe something different, but that’s the way I feel. I hope you feel you did the right thing and don’t have any regrets.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>The Sunflower</p>
   <p>I think <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon Wiesenthal</persName> made a good decision when he walked away from the dying <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS man</term>. This man wanted <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term> from a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> for killing other <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term>. By forgiving the SS man, that does not bring the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> back to life.</p>
   <p>Nobody is a born a murderer, they have got to pick that up along the way by some of decisions they make. And if every <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">nazi </term>feels bad for what they did to all the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> and we forgive them, then we are forgiving the nazis for what they did to our people. Simon also had no authority to forgive him. Even if he did have the authority to give the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS man</term> forgiveness, why should the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> let a nazi murderer die in peace while at that same moment hundreds of additional <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> were dying from much worst scenarios. At least when this man died he had a nicely planted sunflower atop his grave in his one-man coffin. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> are packed so tightly together when they were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-539" type="subject">laid in a pile of dirt </term>.</p>
<p>We could not forgive this man because he helped <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000185">Hitler</persName> come to his reign and enabled him to have followers to kill all those people. Nobody is a born murderer, so many others are also looking for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846">forgiveness</term> as they traveled through the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">concentration camps</term> and watched the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> die. If he really wanted to be forgiven he should have dropped out of the SS the day he killed the family and started <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-297" type="subject">helping the Jews</term>. The fact that he still went on killing after that means we shouldn’t forgive him. Yet maybe, if he joined the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-317">Hitler Youth</orgName> because some of his friends did and enlisted because he was scared that if he didn’t enlist they would come looking for him <emph>maybe</emph> we could understand. But, according to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jewish</term> 
 Talmud you should <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-736">sacrifice</term> yourself
 before you kill another man therefore we should not offer <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846">forgiveness</term>.</p>

<p>The Sunflower By: <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon Wiesenthal</persName></p>
<p>A young <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> is taken from a <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-1749" type="camp">death-camp</placeName> to a makeshift <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">army
      hospital</term>. He is led to the bedside of a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120">Nazi soldier</term> whose head is completely
    swathed in bandages. The dying <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi
    </term> blindly extends his hand toward the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term>, and in a cracked whisper begins to speak. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> listens silently while the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi
    </term> confesses to having participated in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-540" type="subject">burning</term> alive of an entire village of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">Jews</term>. The soldier, terrified of dying with this burden of guilt, begs
    absolution from the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term>. Having listened to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi
     </term>’s story for several hours torn between horror and
     compassion for the dying man – the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> finally walks out of the room without speaking.</p>
<p>I would have done the same thing. What else could have been done? Would you stay there and
    comfort him? The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> is in a hard spot, so is the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi
     </term>. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi
    </term> was probably oppressed by the people he loved, followed and believed in. If he
    didn’t join he wouldn’t feel safe in his own country. What can you say to </p>

<p>someone who just confessed to you that he killed hundreds of your people? The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> as young as this one cannot think of what to do in such situations. For him
    there was nothing he could have said that wouldn’t have made him or the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi
    </term> feel any better. I think it was an O.K. choice for the situation. If I were in that
    situation I would have done the same thing. The person who just asked for his <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness </term>tortured him. He had to eat grass and sleep on the ground because of
 these people. He was tricked into hating the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">Jews</term>. <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000185">Hitler</persName>
 blamed all of <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2921044/germany.html">Germany</placeName>’s troubles on the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">Jews</term> so he would probably not have gone against his
 entire country. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> lost many of his friends to these people. Josek was one of these
    people. How was he going to forgive the Man who killed Josek? There was very little time to
    make his decision. Therefore acting on instinct he made a quick, witty, solid decision to
    leave the Nazi on his deathbed. The guilt of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi
    </term> was not relieved. So the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi
    </term> was left on his deathbed to die and wither in the
 corners of his own dark world in the corners of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">Hell</term>(or whatever those Germans believed in)</p>
