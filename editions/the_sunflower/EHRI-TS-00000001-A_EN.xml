This body was charged to oversee humane conditions in POW camps among civilian internees during wartime, but gained limited access to concentration camps. With the exception of two visits to Dutch inmates interned at Buchenwald in 1940, and the inspection of Theresienstadt at the behest of the Danish government (where they were fooled in by the SS in 1944), the Red Cross was never able to enter concentration camps until late in the war. The ICRC did not take great initiatives to intervene on behalf of the Jews for fear losing its credibility with the Axis Powers, thus losing its position to work on behalf of POWs and civilian internees. In 1995, ICRC president, Cornelio Sommaruga, finally admitted his agency&#x2019;s inaction during the Holocaust.</p></note></org><org><orgName>Hitler-Jugend</orgName><linkGrp><link type="normal" target="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-317"/></linkGrp><note><p>1926-07-27/1945-05-07</p><p>Hitler approved officially the establishment of the Hitler-Jugend on 1926-07-27 and placed under the Sturmabteilung (Storm Division). Between 1933 and 1945 that vast majority of German&#x2019;s children were members of the HJ, the junior branch of the Nazi Party. Boys were taught the beliefs of National Socialism and trained for military service. Determining that by age ten children&#x2019;s minds could be turned from play to politics, the regime inducted nearly all German juveniles between ages of ten and eighteen into its state-run organization. The result was a potent tool for the will of Adolf Hitler. When Nazi Germany finally surrendered on 1945-05-07, the HJ came to an end.</p></note></org><org xml:id="ehri_ts_der_stuermer"><orgName>Der St&#xFC;rmer</orgName><note><p>Der St&#xFC;rmer was an antisemitic weekly newspaper founded and published in Nuremberg on April 20, 1923 by Julius Streicher, who later became the NSDAP Gauleiter  of Franconia.

<p>Sunflowers</p>
<p>Synopsis</p>
      <p>Summer <date when="1946">1946</date>&#x2013; my first trip into <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1105" type="subject">bombed</term>-out Southern <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/11612754/bundesrepublik-deutschland-bis-1990.html">Germany</placeName>. When I asked to see <persName ref="#ehri_ts_karl_sunflower">Karl</persName>'s mother I was shown a house in which only a few apartments were still inhabitable. I was received by an oldish lady. She was the widow of a shop foreman. The black-bordered picture on the wall was the first thing I saw. For the first time I was struck by his eyes. I sat down and didn't know how to begin. A scene, three years past, rose up in my mind.</p>
<p>I said: "Your son asked me to look you up." The woman started to cry and told me that her life had lost its purpose, told me things I already knew. "He was a good boy, he sang in the church choir. Then <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000185">Hitler</persName> came. My husband was a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-982" type="subject">socialist</term>, he had plenty of trouble and didn't get along with his son. But <persName ref="#ehri_ts_karl_sunflower">Karl</persName> was a good child. He often said to me that he didn't understand his father and that his father did not understand the new times. I felt caught as between hammer and evil, between husband and son.</p>
<p>My husband always said things were bound to end badly. They were quite estranged. And then the War came. My son volunteered. My husband said nothing, didn't talk about the victories or the defeats. And then, one day, this blow fell. I got a small package containing my son's possessions, he had died in a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term> in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/702550/lviv.html">Lemberg</placeName>. And then came the accident in the factory, and I was a widow."</p>
<p>The old woman went to a closet and brought out a small bundle. It contained a notebook, a watch and some other small items. She handled them very tenderly. I looked at the bundle (the stuff); I had seen it before.</p>
      <p>When the woman thought that she had told all there was to tell, she sat down. She said: "I am so poor now, that I have nothing to offer you. We are <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-570" type="subject">starving</term>, you know.&#x2013; But you said you knew my son. Where did you get to know him? And you said he told you to visit me, Did he say anything about me? At the time he didn't know that his father was dead. Did he speak about him?&#x201D;</p>
<pb n="2" facs="EHRI-TS-00000001-A_02.jpg"/>
<p>She overwhelmed me with questions. I sat and stared at the picture. I really had thought of <persName ref="#ehri_ts_karl_sunflower">Karl</persName> in a different way. I didn't want it to be true that he had been looking like this. The mother saw my silence.</p>
<p>I said: "I saw him in a transport, it was a hospital transport." I lied: "One of them threw a slip of paper out of the train. On the paper he asked to send regards to his mother. I picked up the paper, memorized the address but I don't have the paper anymore." The woman asked me if I was a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1097" type="subject">soldier</term> too.</p>
<p>"No", I said," I was... a civilian."</p>
<p>"He was a good boy", the old lady said again and again, "you know, a good boy. Today he would be a support to me."</p>
<p>I looked at the old woman and also thought of other mothers whose dead or killed sons could be their support today.</p>
<p>As I visited her, I had had no plan what to say to the old woman. It had been the curiosity, it had been the wish to get rid of an experience &#x2013; an experience that, since I was a free man again, had often haunted my sleepless nights.</p>
<p>Now I was here and didn't know what to say. One thing I knew, I couldn't tell this poor woman the truth. Why should one rob her of a belief which was so vital to her. What would be the good of that. </p>
<p>I told her nothing of that which I knew. I repeated once more the lie about the slip of paper from the hospital train.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
      <p>A hot September day in 1942. We are marching to a new working place of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">Concentration Camp</term> in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/702550/lviv.html">Lemberg</placeName>. They had put together</p>
  <pb n="3" facs="EHRI-TS-00000001-A_03.jpg"/>
  <p>a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-557" type="subject">cleaning crew</term> (garbage disposal crew). This morning I was ordered to join them. Russian deputy <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject">policemen</term> and some <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS-men</term> were escorting us.</p>
      <p>The road along Janowskastreet leads past a soldier's <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-748" type="subject">cemetery</term>. Sunflower after sunflower stands upright on each grave. I am marching and I can't take my eyes off the sunflowers. Every dead man beneath those sunflowers seems to me like one, who, in the depth of the ocean, <del>catches</del> <add>takes in</add> the world outside with a periscope. And so, <del>the dead soldier has over </del>the sunflower <add>links</add> <del>a connection with the world</del> <add>the dead soldier with the world</add>.</p>
      <p>I am thinking of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-539" type="subject">mass grave</term> that is <del>expecting </del> <add>awaiting</add> me and the others. I can see that the other prisoners also cannot take their eyes off the flowers. Still I don't know where we are going. The column turns and now we are on <ref target="https://uma.lvivcenter.org/pl/photos/1464">Sapiehy Street</ref> and soon we are at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv_Polytechnic">College of Technology</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv_Polytechnic"> </ref>where I had been studying and getting my diploma. Everything seems so unreal to me. I, in my torn and tattered KZ-<ref target="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/vocabularies/ehri_terms/search?q=cloth*">clothes</ref>, find myself all of a sudden standing in the courtyard of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv_Polytechnic">Technical College</ref>. I had been studying there for four years. Countless <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-329" type="subject">antisemitic excesses</term> with <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/798544/poland.html">Polish</placeName> students come back into my memory. "Day without <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term>&#x201D; when we <del>wanted to go to the exams</del> <add>were about to take the examinations organized to defeat us (with all the cards stacked against us!</add></p>
<p>And now I am standing here with a shovel and am loading a wagon with bloody bandages and puss-drenched cotton and other garbage. The College of Technology has become a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term> for hundreds of wounded soldiers. The sharp smell of medicines mixes with the stench of decaying arms and legs. A <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-419">Red Cross</orgName> sister approaches</p>
  <pb n="4" facs="EHRI-TS-00000001-A_04.jpg"/>
  <p>and asks me:</p>
<p>"Are you a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term>?"</p>
<p>I nod.</p>
<p>She says: "Follow me."</p>
<p>I think she wants me to follow her because she has a piece of bread or something else for me. </p>
<p>She leads me to the back staircase and from there up to the first floor to a small room which used to belong to the Dean of the Department of Architecture, the very department where I graduated.</p>
<p>I stop at the door.</p>
<p>The situation is not clear to me. She calls me into the room. I can only see something white. A white face. When I come nearer, I see chalky white hands on top of the bed cover, an entirely bandaged face with little openings around mouth and ears.</p>
<p>The sister whispers to the wounded man and then I hear his voice.</p>
<p>"Please come nearer, I can't speak loud."</p>
<p>The door closes behind the sister.</p>
<p>I feel uneasy. The wounded man is holding my hand.</p>
<p>I sit down.</p>
<p>"I won't live much longer and I asked the sister to find me a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term>. She told me that there are <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> working at the garbage disposal. My name is <persName ref="#ehri_ts_karl_sunflower">Karl</persName>...... I was a volunteer of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">Waffen-SS</term><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">.</term> </p>
<p>I must tell you a terrible story. I know since a year that the thing I have done was inhuman. But I have to tell you about it."</p>
<p>Was there anything inhuman of which I had not heard already?</p>
      <pb n="5" facs="EHRI-TS-00000001-A_05.jpg"/>
<p>I looked into the bandages of his head but I could not see his eyes. What I saw was the sunflower. He will have a sunflower, I thought. </p>
<p>I sat in silence.</p>
<p>He asked if I could follow him. He told me a lot of his childhood, it was like a confession. Of the friends with whom he played, of the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-317">Hitler-youth</orgName>, of his enthusiasm. He told me how he had volunteered for the army, how he had gone to the war as to a festival.</p>
<p>First the war with <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/798544/republic-of-poland.html">Poland</placeName>. It was a description of the [sic]</p>
<p>I sat as on coals.</p>
<p>It seemed to me like a macabre joke that I, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> who was destined to be killed, should be kind of confessor of an <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS-man</term>.</p>
<p>His hand didn't let me go. I was for him the means by which he wanted to accomplish something before he died. I felt it, something terrible was going to come.</p>
<p>Again and again he interrupted himself, breathing heavily, apparently forgetting that I was there.</p>
<p>I tried to slip my hand out of his. but he gripped it harder. He started to speak again.</p>
<p>In my mind I lived through my own confession. I also saw back into my youth, I too remembered my childhood friends. I don't know how and why. The words he spoke mixed with my own thoughts.</p>
      <p>Then he told of the war with the <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/8354411/union-of-soviet-socialist-republics.html">Soviet Union</placeName>, told about the truck-loads of books which "Der <orgName ref="#ehri_ts_der_stuermer">St&#xFC;rmer</orgName>" sent to them, told of the conversations in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term> canteens. &#x2013; Now they were going to smoke</p>
        <pb n="6" facs="EHRI-TS-00000001-A_06.jpg"/>
      <p>out the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-363" type="subject">"subhumans"</term>. Great perspectives were opening up before them. <persName ref="#ehri_ts_karl_sunflower">Karl</persName> told of it with bitterness.</p>
<p>I saw in front of me the long hospital trains. Were they all boys like <persName ref="#ehri_ts_karl_sunflower">Karl</persName>, those soldiers, tiding back home or behind the front? I asked myself.</p>
<p>He was quiet again. I forgot where I was.</p>
<p>Flies, allured into the room by the smell of medicines and puss, were humming. Around the head of the invalid, too. I chased the flies away. He felt it although he could not see. He said: "Thank you." It was a relief to him.</p>
<p>And then he told on. I felt that he was collecting his strength to tell me something terrible.</p>
      <p>&#x201C;With great rejoicing did we arrive at <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/709930/dnipro.html">Dniepropetrowsk</placeName>. Everywhere abandoned cars, abandoned canons. The <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583">Russians</orgName> were leaving in hast. And when we were inside, whole blocks of houses exploded. We had many dead, many wounded. There came all of a sudden on a truck a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1084" type="subject">Hauptsturmf&#xFC;hrer</term>, he spoke with the chief of our troops, we went into formation and reached into another part of the city.</p>
      <p>I saw a group of people standing there. At first I didn't know who they were. Only later I found out that they were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term>. We got the order to drive them into a house and we did. Then there came a truck and brought cans with gasoline. We carried them into the house to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term>. It was a three story building. There were about 150 to 200 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> in the house. </p>
<p>We waited outside. Still we didn't know what was going to happen. Then came some men from a "<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1087" type="subject">Rollkommando</term>" and joined us. The time of waiting was shortened for us through a supply of brandy.</p>
      <pb n="7" facs="EHRI-TS-00000001-A_07.jpg"/>
<p>The bottle went from mouth to mouth and then came&#x2026;"</p>
<p>He interrupted again.</p>
<p>A portion of rum was distributed. When the shelling had finished, it was our turn to go. I jumped out of our trench and joined all the others running towards the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583">Russian</orgName> lines. Suddenly I saw something, very distant, very small... It was the family, the family from <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/709930/dnipro.html">Dniepropetrowsk</placeName> &#x2013; all aflame. </p>
<p rend="lmarg1">I stood rooted in the ground. In this moment, a grenade exploded quite near. It tore up my face. </p>
      <p>I am being dragged from field-<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term> to field-<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term>. Why on earth don't they send me home? Nothing shortens my pain. For a long time I was unconscious. But as soon as I awoke and became aware of my condition I always thought back to that event. Now I have been in this <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject">hospital</term> in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/702550/lviv.html">Lemberg</placeName>, since three months, and I know I won't make it much longer. And I don't mind. But</p>
  <pb n="8" facs="EHRI-TS-00000001-A_08.jpg"/>
  <p>what is really bad is, I feel I can't die. I know that I bear a great guilt; for what were these poor people guilty of? I am young, just 22, and am now to end my life with such a horror. As a child I felt very much drawn to God. My comrades in the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-317">Hitler-Youth</orgName> often ridiculed me and called me a religious fanatic.</p>
<p>I don't want to die without getting this straight. A confession you'd call it. But what is a confession? A confession is a letter yet unanswered."</p> 
<p>I said nothing. </p>
<p>The horrors of which he spoke were then so frequent in so many parts of <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/6255148/europe.html">Europe</placeName> that they had almost become monotonous. Each dreadful report was worse than the last. Here I found myself facing a man, a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">murderer</term>, who didn't want to be a murderer and who wanted to confide his crime to me, a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term>. His words indicated real repentance. How many such killers was I still to confront, today, tomorrow...? And for how much longer?</p>
<p>Karl continued to speak.</p>
<p>"Believe me, words cannot express my yearning to undo what I have done. So many young people are being killed on the battlefields. Why should this burden me. But as for you, I don't know who you are. As far as I am concerned, you are a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term>, and if you are a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term>, then you are suffering."</p>
      <p>I kept silent. I, too, envisioned this burning family which he had described, jumping to their death from a window in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/709930/dnipro.html">Dniepropetrowsk</placeName>. I felt a part of them, felt a participant in their ghostly appearance before the tranches of Taganrog, an apparition which could cause an <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term>-man not to seek cover against an</p>
  <pb n="9" facs="EHRI-TS-00000001-A_09.jpg"/>
      <p>oncoming grenade.</p>
<p>"I want to die in peace, but for that I need..." He stopped.</p>
<p>Not till then did I notice that I was no longer holding his hand. When he had begun telling about <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/709930/dnipro.html">Dniepropetrowsk</placeName> I had withdrawn it. Now I noticed that he was reaching out for me. I moved closer to the bed.</p>
<p>"I know I have told you something terrible. Through long nights, while waiting for death, I wanted and wanted to tell this to a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> and ask his <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term>. I know that I'm asking for much, for very much. But if you could forgive me, then I would die in peace. It's the only thing I now desire."</p>
<p>You could hear a pin drop.</p>
<p>Suddenly I began to see clearly. This fateful war had brought together two people. One of them wanted to die but couldn't, because he felt haunted by his terrible crime. The other had to die but didn't want to because he wanted to live to see the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1218" type="subject">criminals</term> vanquished. Without a word I got up and left the room. I went down the stairs and out through the main gate, just as I had done for four years while studying at this college. I didn't notice that I wore prison garb with the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">Concentration Camp</term> number. I saw soldiers, I saw doctors in white coats, I saw medics and nurses. Before I knew it I was outside in the courtyard. The group with which I had come was eating lunch. I still managed to get a cup of soup. But my thoughts remained with the dying <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS-man</term>. At five o'clock in the afternoon we marched back. Again we marched through Janowska Street, once more I saw the military cemetery, once more the sunflowers. How eager I was for them.</p>
<p><del>I thought: By tomorrow <persName ref="#ehri_ts_karl_sunflower">Karl</persName> will have his sunflower</del>.</p>
      <pb n="10" facs="EHRI-TS-00000001-A_10.jpg"/>
      <p>I thought: By tomorrow <persName ref="#ehri_ts_karl_sunflower">Karl</persName> will have his sunflower. By then I may be lying in a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-539">mass grave</term>, if today the order comes to liquidate the barracks in which I live in the camp, or maybe all of us.</p>
<p>In the evening I told this story to a friend. But there was not much time for philosophizing. "Be glad that there is one less", he said. Was I glad? I felt confused.</p>
<p>The next day I tried to persuade one of the guards to assign me to another group. I was told that in a few days I would be going back to my old job on the railroad. We were told that we would be in this camp only for a few days for new registration. But my attempt proved futile, and I found myself back with the garbage crew. Again my column moved past the sunflowers, and again I was back in the yard of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv_Polytechnic">Technical College</ref>. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">nurse</term> who had asked me the day before came out again. She didn't recognize me immediately.</p>
<p>First she talked to others and then she came towards me. </p>
<p>"Please come with me." </p>
<p>I was really afraid. I felt unable to listen to further confessions of this type. But we only stepped into the doorway. She apparently didn't know what was at issue. She only said: "The soldier you saw yesterday died during the night. He asked me to give you all his possessions with the exception of his watch and a few photos which I am supposed to send to his mother. Here is the bundle."</p>
<p>She wanted to hand it to me but I refused to take it. I didn't even want to touch it. I said:</p>
<p>"I don't need this stuff, <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">nurse</term>. Send it all to his mother." The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">nurse</term> looked at me without saying anything and went away.</p>
  <pb n="11" facs="EHRI-TS-00000001-A_11.jpg"/>
  <p>I returned to my group.</p>
<p>In 1945, when I was living in the death section of the <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-570" type="camp">Concentration Camp Mauthausen</placeName>, waiting for death, I remembered this episode. I had plenty of time to remember: I had been <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-570" type="subject">starving</term> since two months and looked like a skeleton.</p>
<p>I kept asking myself whether I had acted properly, but I found no answer. </p>
<p>Years passed, I was free. Sometimes, when visiting a <ref target="http://hospital/">hospital</ref> and seeing <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">nurses</term> and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-286" type="subject">doctors</term>, or people with bandaged heads, I think back of Karl. I see him, but alive. I had seen his picture on the wall, I had seen his mother and had not been able to contradict her when she said that he had been a good boy. He had been that as a child. A merciless time made him a killer.</p>
<p>Could I have forgiven him? I am still not sure. The man showed regret. Was he able in his life to make up for his wrongdoing? Was I entitled to refuse the last wish of a dying man? Was I entitled to forgive him in the name of those no longer living?....</p>
<p>I wrote to well-known philosophers of various religious denominations asking them to answer according with the principles of their <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-725" type="subject">religions</term>: How should I have behaved in this case?</p>
