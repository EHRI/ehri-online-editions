      <p>Dear <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName>:</p>
      <p>Please forgive me the familiarity of addressing you by first name. I think you will understand when I tell you that I was an <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/6252001/united-states.html">American</placeName> <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1078">infantry</term> soldier and was among the first to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-573" type="subject">liberate</term> <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">Nazi slave and murder camps</term> in the advances of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1087">Third Army</term> at the end of World War II. Those memories and the duties that I owe the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jewish</term> people and mankind are indelibly engraved upon me as a result of that experience. There is not one day nor a single night that I do not think of the Holocaust. You are an active principal of that memory and to you I feel brotherhood because but for the fate that my father left <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/798544/poland.html">Poland</placeName> in time for me to be born in this <term ref="https://www.geonames.org/6252001/united-states.html">country</term>I would not have escaped the terrible fate of most of our European <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term>. Living <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> seem always to be either direct survivors of a disaster or to have benefited by one generation that managed to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">escape</term> in time to avoid that disaster.</p>
      <p>Your <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-683">book</term> "The Sunflower" has been on my mind for many months. It is my hope that you will take time to read my thinking concerning the important question that you asked. </p>
      <p>I addressed you in a familiar sense because I believe that for us there are two kinds of people in this world. Those who are willing to accept into themselves some experience of the Holocaust and those who will not. There are those that seek to understand or find significance from the terrible events and those that ignore or avoid the subject. To avoid the subject, this watershed of moral history, is to avoid responsibility to God and the understanding of Human responsibility. All who seek understanding do thereby not evade responsibility and also seek God – however distant or remote He may seem. A religious or moral person must come to grips with what makes evil and good, transgression, sin and ultimately <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term>. You have condensed it all into the one confrontation and experience.</p>

      <p>A <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> who does not take the experience of the Holocaust into himself – who does not identify with or at least to some small measure feel the suffering – has betrayed his heritage.</p>

      <p>A Christian who does not face the problem of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-353">Christian causation of the Holocaust</term>, of the guilt that devolves on <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-763">Christianity</term> for the centuries that it taught that the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864">Jews</term> is to be despised and hated, cannot be considered as a God fearing religious person but only as another Idolator with a profession of faith and belief but not a responsibility either to God or man. Christians must learn to face that criminal churchly teachings created an atmosphere making it possible to hate and despise the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864">Jews</term> and to tolerate such hate and despising as not inconsistent with <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-763">Christianity</term>. Those teachings and the toleration of such teachings created the terrible climate in which the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864">Jews</term> have suffered for two millenia and set the stage for the awful murders and atrocities for the six million Jews in this century. Shall the Christian ministers and priests protest: "We only meant you to hate the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864">Jews</term>, to despise the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864">Jews</term> – but not to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536">murder the Jews</term>"?</p>

      <p>The dying <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS man</term> in "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunflower_(book)">The Sunflower</ref>", despite his <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-767" type="subject">Catholic</term> childhood and youth, did not send for a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-734" type="subject">priest</term> to hear his confession and to provide the words of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term> or absolution. He knew that any priest that had not spoken out against the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">murders</term>, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazis</term>, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-329" type="subject">anti-Semitism</term> was contaminated, if only as an accomplice, in the sin of murdering <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term>. The dying Nazi knew that <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term> from a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-734" type="subject">priest</term>  for his crime would be tainted and unclean.</p>

      <p>The only hope of the dying <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS
          man</term> was to turn to repentence and to seek <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term> of his <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-132">victims</term>. But the victims were dead and beyond earthly communication. So he sought another suffering
        humiliated <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> as the representative of his people – in the hope that such a
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> would be an ear of God to hear the confession, know that one criminal did
        repent, and provide perhaps a drop of forgiveness for his sin against the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term>. The dying man had taken a correct approach to reconcile his soul with the
        Eternal. In his limited understanding the dying man probably felt that only a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> could serve as his priest.</p>

      <p>Could the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864">Jew</term>, the single <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName>, <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846">forgive</term>? There are three lines of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term>. God can forgive; the victim can forgive; and the sinner can forgive himself. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term> of God, when granted is complete. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term> of the victim can plead for the sinner with God. <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term> of the self by the self enables one to live untroubled in this world. It is almost like having sinned in such innocence as not to recognize that one has sinned. But it seems doubtful that self-<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term> can reconcile the sinner’s soul to God.</p>

      <p><persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> could have "forgiven".

Would it be so complete as if the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi's sin and crimes</term> had been completely expunged? As if they had not existed? As if they had been washed clean away by the blood of the lamb? The blood of his victims? Or was it to be a partial <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term>, leaving a percentage of clinging guilt to the soul of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi </term>so that it was not completely clean as it approached God?

      <p>brothers? Once the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi</term> were forgiven by a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> where would that forgiveness stop and what would be the ultimate significance of the forgiveness? Would it mean the perpetual toleration of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-540" type="subject">mass murder</term>, of mass atrocity and the indifference of mankind? Could any human even attempt to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgive</term> this crime or the indifference that permits the crime?</p>

      <p>By what authority could <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> feel authorized to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgive</term>? Was the authorization of the Nazi sufficient? Would not <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> also need the authorization of his <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">murdered people</term>? And did not the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">murder</term> of that people mock the only God that could confer the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term>?</p>

      <p>If <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> had taken it upon himself to act for the victims would he not have betrayed those victims again and compounded the crime? In <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-756" type="subject">Jewish religion and law</term>. I believe that it is stated that only the victim can forgive. <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> was and continues to this day a victim of Nazism and of the indifference of the world. Should he <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgive</term> that? Could he <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgive</term> the one repentent Nazi, if only for the sin against himself, while he himself or his people continued to suffer?</p>

      <p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi</term> did repent, and now that he was near death and out of danger of his fellows for repentent conduct, he made an offering to <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName>. Or rather he bequeathed to <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> his belongings. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi</term> recognized that even after his own death it was possible that <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> could still forgive him. <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> knew that the offering would provoke and enhance the spirit of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term> if it were accepted but acceptance of the offering of the package of personal belongings also meant betrayal of <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName>'s suffering comrades to increased suffering and probable prompt painful death. The personal belongings were most probably clothes and documents that would have enabled <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> to disguise himself and have a chance to escape, to have some freedom, to live!</p>

      <p>The refusal of the package by <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> marks him as a very singular human – a special Jew, <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-736">one of the Just</term>. <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> had been clearly tested by God and set aside his personal interests to share in the common lot of suffering humanity and his fellow Jews. He recognized the repentence of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi</term> and remembered the obligation. After <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> was liberated and regained some health and strength he paid <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-736">a "shiva" </term>call on the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS man</term>'s mother and added <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-736" type="subject">mitzvah</term> to his silence. <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> did a private personal service for the dead enemy, an act of personal forgiveness that did not affect his status with his people, and provided some measure of relief of suffering to the dead man's innocent mother. It was the special act of a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-736" type="subject">Just man</term>.</p>

      <p>The Holocaust is the work of men but in that colossal crime God posed questions and it is in the answers we give that we acknowledge and affirm allegiance to God and the laws that God has given to us. The Holocaust poses a question to mankind and especially to those who profess to be religious. It is through the study and response to that question that one can determine his relation to God and the validity of his beliefs.</p>

      <p><persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName>, a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-332" type="subject">suffering humiliated Jew victim</term>, could have in his brief moment of power tormented the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120" type="subject">Nazi</term> and vocally have denied forgiveness. But <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> sat quietly and listened with horror but without hate, and with some measure of pity for the tormented soul. <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> did not forgive but neither did he deny <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term> to the dying man. He heard the confession and understood the repentence. <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> was silent throughout and he did not verbally abuse or reproach the dying man for it is prohibited by <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-756" type="subject">Jewish law</term> to oppress the penitent.</p>

      <p><persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> knew, despite Simon's question to us, that he had no authority to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgive</term>; that it was beyond his duty to do more than listen. The suffering of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS man</term> was between the man and God but the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term> was conceived as the conduit for the final prayers of the penitent dying man to God and to the remnant of the Jewish people for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term>. In part it was to transmit that final prayer to the Jewish <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">people</term> that <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon</persName> was preserved to this world. The remaining and continuing <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> in this world can only answer or think about that prayer affirmatively if it is accompanied by true repentence from those that have sinned or have been accomplices in the sin of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-329" type="subject">anti-Semitism</term>. <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-756">Maimonides</term> taught that repentence begins in thought and is followed by words of confession and the penitent must break with the sinful past and endeavor to correct the wrong.</p>

      <p>I doubt that the dead <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS man</term> even in his repentence, or any repentent <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">murderer of the Jews</term>, can be forgiven or should be forgiven unless the world that created such monsters comes forward with some assurance that there will not be a future victimization or otherwise the act of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term>, even by God, would be futile. The world itself must be the surety, the offering, for the monsterous sin of the Holocaust.</p>

      <p>I bow in respect to God who created you, to the questions that you pose and the answers that your life gives.</p>
