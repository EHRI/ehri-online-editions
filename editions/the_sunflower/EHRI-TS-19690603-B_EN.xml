      <p>Mr <persName ref="#ehri_ts_goul  den_mark">Mark Goulden</persName></p>
      <p>W.H. Allen &amp; Co LTD</p>

      <p>43 Essex Street, Strand</p>
      <p><placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743/london.html">London</placeName> WC2</p>
      <p><placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/6269131/england.html">England</placeName></p>
  
      <p>Dear Mr <persName ref="#ehri_ts_goulden_mark">Goulden</persName>,</p>

      <p>Through Mr <persName ref="#ehri_ts_ronsac_charles">Ronsac</persName> I received your letter of May 27 for which I thank you very much and I am very happy that you will be the publisher
        for the British edition of my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-683" type="subject">book</term>.</p>

      <p>I have read your letter with interest and I want to express clearly, that The Sunflower is
        a personal experience of mine, which I have written down perhaps to get rid of it as with
        the time I started to doubt myself about my attitude at that time.</p>
      <p>If this does not come out clearly then it is the fault of the book – or perhaps it might
        also be a mistake of the translation or interpretation as I have written the manuscript in
        German. All the contributors I contacted up to now have understood it as a personal
        experience.</p>
      <p>There is one <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-904" type="subject">survivor</term> of that time, living in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/293397/tel-aviv.html">Tel Aviv</placeName>, he is an
        <persName ref="ehri_ts_porath_zeev">engineer</persName> who had been in the same <placeName ref="#ehri_ts_janowska_camp">camp</placeName>
        but unfortunately not in the same barrack. He knew all about this event and when I met him
        after the war, we discussed this matter again.</p>
      <p>The dialogues of course are reconstructed – they are not to be taken verbally but the sense
        and direction of the dialogues are true.</p>

      <p>Arthur was a man of high intelligence, he was a writer who quite often had no sense for
        reality when he had to face a problem and Josek, whose name I do not remember, was a very
        religious man. He might have been a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-735" type="subject">rabbi</term> but I rather think he was a businessman with an extended religious
        knowledge.</p>

      <p>However that may be the described situation comports all characteristics of that period and
        should give an answer to all, who our days call for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">forgiveness</term>– it should answer them that their claim is addressed to the wrong
        direction as the real an actual addressees who could forgive are dead and we are not their
        substitute to forgive in their name.</p>
      <p>Here starts the origin of the conflict in the conception between <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864">Jews</term> and
        gentiles and this conflict situation is the actual background of the divergation [sic] of opinions between <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864">Jews</term> and
        gentiles regarding the duty to forgive or not.</p>

      <pb n="2" facs="EHRI-TS-19690603-B_02.jpg"/>
      <p>I hope to have explained my point of view.</p>

      <p>I will be in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743/london.html">London</placeName> around October as I am working on a new project, treating
        events in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/6269131/england.html">England</placeName> but on a complete different field even it plays in
        war-times.</p>

      <p>I will be very happy to meet you on this occasion and I am looking forward to it.</p>

      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

      <p>Jul. 2, 1969</p>

      <p>Mr <persName ref="#ehri_ts_goulden_mark">Mark Goulden</persName></p>
      <p>W.H. Allen &amp; Co. Ltd.</p>

      <p>43, Essex Street, Strand</p>
      <p><placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743/london.html">London</placeName> , W.C.
        2</p>


      <p>Dear Mr <persName ref="#ehri_ts_goulden_mark">Goulden</persName>,</p>

      <p>Back in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2761369/vienna.html">Vienna</placeName> I would like to express my joy to have known you personally. I am sure now
        that “The Sunflower” lies in good hands. After all it is for me not only a book. I wrote but
        an experience I have been accompanied by for more than two dozen years, and which often I
        remember.</p>

      <p>Now I have read your publisher’s note.<note type="gloss">The text was eventually published
          as one of the commentaries in the 1970 English edition of the book.</note> I had it
        translated into German to understand your words precisely, and I want to tell you that I was
        truly impressed by it. But nevertheless I take the liberty to make some observations in
        addition, because I think that we both want the same thing: we would like the import of the
        “Sunflower” to remain in the hearts of the readers.</p>

      <p>Therefore I would preserve myself to set up generalizations and collectivisms. Thus doing
        how could we distinguish ourselves from those we oppose?</p>

      <p>I would like to tell you that I did not always hold the view I hold nowadays. In the first
        two years after the War I had been shaken between collectivism and justice. Having lost my
        whole family and having escaped by chance the massacre, for me everyone who spoke German was
        suspicious. But then I reached the conviction that collectivisms are a weapon of
        dictatorship to subjugate men.</p>

      <p>Collectivisms made it impossible for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-381">Nazis</term> to see or find good <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864">Jews</term>.</p>

      <p>Then I remembered something of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-738">Bible</term>, something that has a meaning for hundreds of
        millions of men.</p>

      <p>The Bible has been analyzed several thousands of times by scholars and philosophers of
        religion and nothing accidental could be found in its import. The thesis against collective
        sin is established firmly in the Bible, particularly in the narration about Sodom and
        Gomorrha: Abraham contends with God and conjures Him not to destroy the cities, where maybe
        one-hundred or twenty or ten righteous live.</p>

      <p>After all there are thousands of men who were helped by <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2921044/germany.html">Germans</placeName> to survive. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-381">Nazis</term>s ruled
        also in the name of these <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2921044/germany.html">Germans</placeName>, and certainly against their will. But for cowardice or
        for the lack of will to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-212">resist</term> nobody can or must be condemned, let alone the young
        generation for the sins of their elders.</p>

      <p>Therefore – I tell you quite frankly – I was rather unhappy to find the terms “<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-381">Nazi</term>” and
        “German” equalized in your publisher’s note. They must not be.</p>

      <pb n="4" facs="EHRI-TS-19690603-B_04.jpg"/>

      <p>Another thing yet: I, who brought before <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1129">justice</term> more than 1100 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-381">Nazis</term>, – I, who dedicated a
        quarter of a century to the prosecution of those who killed innocent human beings, – I had
        innumerable conversations with young <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2921044/germany.html">Germans</placeName> who were ashamed that the <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2921044/germany.html">German</placeName> name had been
        spoiled; they were deeply afflicted. I cannot, must not, and do not want to obstruct their
        way into their life by making them guilty with others.</p>

      <p>That has nothing to do with the 9 millions of former <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-120">Nazis</term>.</p>

      <p>Still in the <placeName ref="#ehri_ts_janowska_camp">camp</placeName>, I made some <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-675">drawings</term> from the death-block, and I published
        them at the first anniversary of my <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-573">liberation</term> from the camp.<note type="gloss">Simon
          Wiesenthal, KZ Mauthausen: Bild und Wort. Vienna-Linz: Ibis Verlag 1946</note> As a motto I
        travestied the words of Jesus Christ: “Oh, Lord, don’t forgive them, because they knew what
        they did”, referring to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-381">Nazis</term>.</p>

      <p>So may I ask you to take these my – and if you reconsider the matter, certainly also your –
        thoughts into your publisher’s note und [and] to alter the respective parts in accordance
        with the “Sunflower” how I wrote it.</p>

      <p>Your note will not sustain loss by doing thus, its important will remain the same.</p>

      <p>Other two details: I am speaking about eleven millions of human beings who were killed,
        among them six millions of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864">Jews</term>. The problem must not be reduced to a mere problem between
        <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864">Jews</term> and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-381">Nazis</term>.</p>

      <p>As to the refusals of the theologians, this probably concerns only <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/6269131/england.html">England</placeName>, and that should
        be made clear.</p>

      <p>Let me also remark that in my book “The Murderers Among Us” and in numerous articles,
        radio- and TV-interviews I gave my views on the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-381">Nazis</term> problem. People know that I do not feel
        any <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846">vengefulness</term> and that I am against any <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846">collective guilt</term>. Also the personalities I
        approached for their comments have known my views on the subject and complied with my
        request, even not knowing me personally. I am sure none of the authors – or very few – would
        have answered had I equalized <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-381">Nazis</term> and <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2921044/germany.html">Germans</placeName> in my book.</p>

      <p>That is an obligation for me I want to observe, and I want you to know that.</p>

      <p>Approaching the authors I heeded to let them understand without any doubt that their
        answers were addressed to me. The manuscripts dispatched by <orgName ref="#ehri_ts_opera_mundi">OPERA MUNDI</orgName> in different
        languages bore my name as the sender, and not that of <orgName ref="#ehri_ts_opera_mundi">OPERA MUNDI</orgName>. Therefore I think it
        would be preferable to correct the respective passage in your note in a way to make clear
        that it has been my personal request. I hope you understand this.</p>

      <p>I am sure that you accept my words amicably – as surely they were intended. I would like to
        underline again how glad I was to make your acquaintance.</p>

      <p>I am sure that this our book will be vastly read in the English-speaking countries, thanks
        to your effort. Therefore I want to express my gratitude in advance.</p>

      <p>Yours very sincerely</p>
