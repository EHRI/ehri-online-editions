The Documentation Centre[TP1] collected a large number of documents on Nazi perpetrators, Nazi crimes and collaborators. The material, comprising some 8,000 files, together with the Documentation Centre's extensive correspondence, is currently housed in the Simon Wiesenthal Archive of the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies (SWA-VWI), with the majority of documents dating from 1945 to 2005.

<p>The Sunflower by <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon Wiesenthal</persName></p>
  <p>Published by <orgName ref="#ehri_ts_hoffmann_campe">Hoffmann &amp; Campe</orgName>, 1970</p>

<p>After the Second World War, after the collapse of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159" type="subject">Hitler Empire</term>, <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Simon
   Wiesenthal</persName> did not turn to a lighter existence that had become normal again. He
  remained trapped in confrontation with the terrible past and took upon himself the task of
   <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1211" type="subject">searching for the murderers</term>. He founded the <term ref="#ehri_ts_documentation_centre_bjvn">Documentation Center of the
   Federation of Jewish Persecutees</term> in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2761369/vienna.html">Vienna</placeName>. He succeeded in
    tracking down <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000564">Eichmann</persName> and bringing him before the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1130">court</term>. His <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-683">book</term> "And the Murderers Live"
    is filled with this struggle.</p>

<p>In the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-683">book</term> The Sunflower, he confronts himself with his own experience from the time of the haunting events, which he cannot forget. With unsparing honesty, he asks himself whether at the moment he stepped out of the chain of suffering, out of the passivity of the never-ending passion, and was called to action, he had failed.</p>
<p>His deep sense of justice, rooted in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-756" type="subject">Judaism</term> from the very beginning (Abraham's story, <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-738">Gen.18</term>) "to practise justice
    and righteousness" could not tolerate that the most terrible crimes go unpunished; but just
    as unsparingly he questions his conscience. Thus he reports in all simplicity that a nurse
    took him out of the group of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-557">forced labourers</term> and brought him to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282">hospital</term> to a dying
     <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">S.S. man</term>. </p>
  <p>The dying man's head was bandaged; he could not see his eyes. But he could hear his voice. This
     <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">S.S. man</term> had to speak before his end, had to confess terrible misdeeds and did not want
   to go without <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846">forgiveness</term>, <hi rend="bg_00ff00">forgiveness</hi> from
    a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term>,
    from that <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-536" type="subject">group of people he had murdered</term>.</p>
<p>But he, the one who was asked, could not speak, could not answer and could not say any words of
     <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846">forgiveness</term>,
    even though he had to understand that his conscience had awakened in him.</p>
  <p><persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Wiesenthal</persName> tries to come to terms with
    this attitude by speaking out with some other <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-557" type="subject">forced
     labourers</term> who acquit him. But the experience does not let him go and he confronts
    himself with the judgement of his contemporaries, the judgement of the world, as to whether he
    was guilty of not being able to speak a word of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846">forgiveness</term> to the
    dying man. </p>
<p>He has asked eminent thinkers and writers and they have tried to answer his question fairly; they emphasise that the terrible situation in which the questioner found himself as a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-557" type="subject">forced labourer</term>, the suffering, the constant danger of death, the lurking degradation must be taken into account.</p>
   <p>The poet <persName ref="#ehri_ts_hagelstange_rudolf">Hagelstange</persName> sees in the fact
    that the dying <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">S.S. man</term> did not want to confess to a priest in accordance with his
    upbringing, but wanted to make his confession of guilt to a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jew</term>, a
    deeper repentance, an original Christian one, as he says, for which one might also say a primal
    human one, it seems to me. <persName ref="#ehri_ts_hagelstange_rudolf">Hagelstange</persName>
    understands that the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jewish</term> prisoner and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-557" type="subject">forced
     labourer</term> could not speak a word of comfort; a conciliatory gesture would have seemed
    like a betrayal of his own. The theologian <persName ref="#ehri_ts_ehri_ts_gollwitzer_herbert">Helmut
     Gollwitzer</persName> sees in <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Wiesenthal</persName>'s
    efforts to bring the murderers to justice not vindictiveness, as some might have called it, but
    he understands that here someone is fighting for <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846" type="subject">justice</term> for the sake of the human future, who also does not feel free of guilt and is
    moved by the question of divine <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846">forgiveness</term>.</p>
   <p><persName ref="#ehri_ts_madariaga_salvador">Salvador Madariaga</persName>, diplomat and writer
    again sees in the inability to speak a word of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846">forgiveness</term> the
    reaction of the tribesman. <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Wiesenthal</persName>
    himself had probably said "Many will condemn me for not making it easier for this repentant
    murderer to die". So <persName ref="#ehri_ts_madariaga_salvador"> Madariaga</persName> judges,
    the universal man saw the dying man, but the tribesman shut his mouth. "And so the dying man
    took his (<persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Wiesenthal</persName>'s) peace with him into
    death". To me, the distinction between universal and tribal seems like the old Christian
    prejudice. The theologian <persName ref="#ehri_ts_gollwitzer_herbert">Gollwitzer</persName>
    understood <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Wiesenthal</persName>'s situation more
    deeply. It was apparently enough for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">S.S.
     man</term> himself that <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Wiesenthal</persName>
    listened to his confession without forgiving him. For - did he really expect <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-846">forgiveness</term> for
    shooting at people who jumped through the window from a burning house? His last will and
    testament, according to which his belongings were given to <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Wiesenthal</persName>, shows this. </p>
  <p><persName ref="#ehri_ts_schuschnigg">Kurt von Schuschnigg</persName>, who was <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2782113/austria.html">Austrian</placeName> Chancellor after
    the assassination of <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000850">Dollfuss</persName> and who had been in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669">prison</term> since the Nazi invasion and in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">K.Z.</term> until the end of the war, gave a different answer. He could not forgive, he said,
    because how could he forgive something that had happened to others? But it had been human of him
    to fulfil the last wish, the listening to his words.</p>
<p>The fact that he was able to speak to someone gave the dying man relief. And so this interviewee
 feels that the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-683">book</term> "The Sunflower" casts a gloomy, but also reconciliatory shadow. At the
    same time, he clearly professes his opposition to the tendency to "forget what has been".
    For the breakthrough of the animalistic always threatens. Through
 <persName ref="#ehri_ts_schuschnigg">Schuschnigg</persName> we also learn what the title: The Sunflower is all about.
    This radiant flower was misused in the criminal past to conceal countless <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">K.Z.</term> walls.</p>
<p>The experience from the dark times did not let go of <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Wiesenthal</persName>,
    so that he went to see the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">S.S.
     man</term>'s mother after the end of the war. But he let her believe that he had died as
    the good boy she mourned him as. This acquaintance with the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">S.S.
     man</term>'s mother makes him wonder why parents who were not infected by the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-363"/>poison of
    Nazism did not exert the slightest influence? After all, the dying <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">S.S.
     man</term> said (38): "My father rarely spoke to me anymore. And when he did, he was
 careful." We find a similar remark in <persName ref="#EHRI-TS-19710400-C_1">Uwe Johnson</persName>'s <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-683">book</term> about the <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/8354410/german-democratic-republic.html">East
  German</placeName> cyclist (68):"  If only he (the father) had spoken once: But he
    completely abandoned me to the school and the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-363" type="subject">Hitler shit</term>."</p>
  <p>That is why it is important that now, in the year 70, a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-683">book</term> like The Sunflower appeared. "Memory is the foundation of civilisation!" is how <persName ref="#ehri_ts_kesten_hermann">Herman Kesten</persName>, the writer, begins his reply to <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Wiesenthal</persName>. "Without memory we would be insensate idiots. Those who have asked us to forget and forgive everything are asking us to become barbarians!" <persName ref="#ehri_ts_wiesenthal_simon">Wiesenthal</persName>'s <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-683">book</term> is such a cultural instrument that keeps consciousness awake and sharpens the conscience and continues the humane life of the human species. So that parents know how to open their mouths and so that young people are not left defenceless at the mercy of an ideology that seizes and poisons them with unrestrained violence and by which everything can be destroyed. Because the danger of "animalism breaking through" exists again and again.</p>
