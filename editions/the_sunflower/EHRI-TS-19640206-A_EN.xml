      <p>Dear Mr. Police Councillor,</p>
      <p>We would like to inform you that we have established a <orgName ref="#ehri_ts_documentation_centre_bjvn">Documentation Center at the Federation of Jewish
          Persecutees</orgName>, which is to continue the activities of the Documentation Center of
        the Federal Association of the Vienna Jewish Community (<orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/at-001985-ikg_ar_1">IKG</orgName>).</p>
      <p>In the enclosure you will find an excerpt from a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-684">diary</term> of a former <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1120">Schutzpolizist</term> of the
        Wachtbatallion 171. This <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject">police battalion</term> was formed in <date when="1940">1940</date> in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2774984/kagran.html">Vienna-Kagran</placeName>, later
        transferred to <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/3078610/brno.html">Br&#xFC;nn</placeName> and sent to <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/690791/ukraine.html">Ukraine</placeName> after the outbreak
        of the German-Soviet <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1080" type="subject">war</term>.</p>
      <p>Although the events in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/709930/dnipro.html">Dnepropetrovsk</placeName> and other localities took place in the summer and autumn of

        according to the law in force in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2782113/austria.html">Austria</placeName> at the time),
        members of this police battalion who were personally involved in the events in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/709930/dnipro.html">Dnepropetrovsk</placeName>, may still be active members of the <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2782113/austria.html">Austrian</placeName> executive.</p>

      <p>After guard duty in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/3078610/brno.html">Br&#xFC;nn</placeName> I was transferred to <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/3061370/zlin.html">Zlin</placeName> to guard the town hall

      <p>Leaving grade very good.</p>

      <p>On <date when="1942-03-27">Mar. 27, 1942</date> I was sent on march with 8 more men to

      <p>We immediately came to the front as replacements for 9 men who fell. The battle was for

      <p>My impression was the worst on the part of the whole formation. Completely demoralized. In every respect, almost criminal.</p>
      <p>I was glad that my inner self warned me in this way. The personal attitude of the entire
        <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject">police force</term> toward the reservists was immediately almost
        hostile.</p>
      <p>I was assigned as a dispatcher right away in the evening after the quartering. After three
        days as a machine gun section with 10 men to <placeName ref="https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B0_(%D1%80%D1%96%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0)">Tetlega</placeName>. There our Hauptwachtmeister shot a 15-year-old lad on his own authority by
        shooting him in the neck.</p>
      <p>Our quarters in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/706483/kharkiv.html">Kharkiv</placeName> were a former cookie factory. There our company commander
        Oberleutnant O, Christ had a boy shoot a girl, allegedly for espionage. In reality she was
        pregnant by him.</p>

      <p>September to December 1941 Here all <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-864" type="subject">Jews</term> of any sex and age were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-550" type="subject">rounded up</term> into <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567" type="subject">camps</term>. They were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-660" type="subject">robbed of all valuables and ornaments</term> (boxes of jewelry, money and
        other valuables accumulated in each action).</p>
      <p>In one day there was a procession of more than 8,000 people accompanied by our 1st company.
        It was all down to the I-dot. At the end of the march, it had become night, this <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject">death march</term> stopped in the open area where there were no people far and wide, on the open
        road.</p>
      <p>By day it was hot. The paths were rotten. At night, freezing cold.</p>
      <p>At dawn, when the train was about to start moving, the poor people were frozen to the
        ground with their clothes and shoes and had to be torn loose by force. In the immediate
        vicinity, the suitable terrain had already been prepared.</p>
      <p>A large <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1321">ravine</term> was covered with planks. They were brought in groups.</p>
      <p>Now one of the biggest historical <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-540" type="subject">mass murders</term> was going on.</p>
      <p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject">police group</term> <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-533">worked</term> like this. They were brought in four and five at
        a time under guard. Here they were received by the group.</p>
      <p>2 men had a kind of wooden fork where he grabbed the person in the back.</p>
      <p>2 men were armed with submachine guns and gave the victim the neck shot or shot in the
        back. Immediately he got a mighty push with the wooden fork and the poor man rolled down
        into the ravine. There were scenes that cannot be described with words.</p>
      <p>A young woman with two small children in her arms hoping that this sight could soften the
        men's hearts when she realized that it was the last moment to live. She calls out to those
        men: Don't you have a wife and child at home, that you are not ashamed to give yourselves
        for such executioner's work.</p>
      <p>Down with this creature, out.</p>
      <p>The next scene: A young lovely woman with her 6 year old girl is on the line. The girl asks
        with raised hands. Please Mr Wachtmeister shoot my mother first, she is so afraid. Next
        scene:</p>
      <p>When guarding the large train, the police also use men from the civilian population. The
        man, a giant of a man, was helping to bring in the victims. There he sees </p>
      <pb n="4" facs="EHRI-TS-19640206-A_04.jpg"/>
      <p>his own wife among the next victims. The two people would not part. A cry of pain from
        these poor people.</p>
      <p>One <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject">policeman</term> wanted to separate them by force. Then the other <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject">policeman</term> was so humane and gave the other one a push of the chest and said: "that
        minute no longer matters, that the two kiss each other goodbye."</p>
      <p>The man was writhing on the ground and with his fingers he scratched the hard-frozen earth
        in his mental pain, so that the blood splashed from his fingers.</p>
      <p>Next scene: A young lad of 20 to 25 came to the turn. A decision was immediately made. He
        pulled out a hidden <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-212">pocket knife</term>, which fortunately had escaped many visitations, drove with
        it across the face of the policeman, a jump into the deep and he disappeared under the many
        bodies of the twitching and flailing people. There were riflemen lined up at the edge of
        this deep natural trench, still shooting at people who were still thrashing about quite a
        bit. After all, one is not immediately dead. There at one point a young woman straightens
        up, covered in blood. She tries to wipe the blood from her eyes with her bloody hands and
        kept screaming: Mother, mother where are you? Until one of those bullets also relieved her
        of this agony and she could sleep peacefully, like her good mother.</p>
      <p>An elderly woman, whose turn it was, says to the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject">policeman</term>: "What is happening here will one day go down in history. You shall all
        be damned". Later, the trench was closed. The earth continued to ripple for several days due
        to the work of the crowds.</p>
      <p>After what I had seen and heard in this harvesting operation, I could understand that these
        people seemed to me to be brutalized, bestialized from the very beginning.</p>
      <p><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1215" type="subject">Partisan</term> fight.</p>
      <p>On Dec. 28., 1942 the leave was over. On the way we were directed to Sinkiwice. This is on
        the line. <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/629634/brest.html">Brest-Litovsk</placeName> &#x2013; <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/625818/luninyets.html">Luninec</placeName> in the <placeName ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pripyat_(river)">Prypet</placeName> area. From there to
        Durow-Tonec. That means before Tonec.</p>
      <p>Even before that the troops had received fire from <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1215" type="subject">partisans</term> and our brave police was put to flight by a few <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1215" type="subject">partisans</term>. During the revenge raid, where they did not find any <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1215" type="subject">partisans</term>, they had 70 people, mostly women and children, taken to the local
        church and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-540" type="subject">shot as punishment</term>. The church was burned down. I was able to see
        for myself when I arrived for the troops.</p>
      <p>Still lying in the south-east corner of the burnt church were the bones of the poor
        victims.</p>
      <pb n="5" facs="EHRI-TS-19640206-A_05.jpg"/>

      <p>The order was to shoot at any person who came near the place.</p>
      <p>I was standing guard. There was a dot approaching from afar.</p>
      <p>It came closer and closer. It was a woman. The civilian population fled from us into the
        woods. It was after Christmas, a cold that the woods sang. Poor, every person who did not
        have a roof over their head. This poor woman could not stand it any longer. She just
        preferred to die in her house. Or so she thought. After all, they are only human and maybe
        even quite good people. I thought, how do I get out of it. Shooting is not done. I spoke
        with the woman, then came group leader H. and asks what is going on. The relief was already
        there. He sent me to the company command post. On the way, the woman asked me for some water.
        I went with her to a bucket. She thanked me warmly. Then she asked me to go into the
        opposite house. I granted her this wish. Now I explained to her that we had to go further,
        because I was being watched. At the Gefechtsstand the woman was examined by a
        Zugwachtmeister, but we found nothing in her bag but old socks and a piece of bread.</p>
      <p>Then the man said: Go with the woman behind the house and shoot her. I explained that I
        don't do that kind of thing. He replied, I'm ordering you to do it. I said, "<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1085" type="subject">You can't order me to do that</term>&#x201D;. He saw that he could not achieve anything with me, so
        he ordered me to go to the second platoon and take two men. I carried out this order.</p>
      <p>I had not gone half the way when I heard two shots.</p>
      <p>Sadly, I went on. The woman made it through, she was no more than 30 years old. Half an
        hour later the order came that the civilians could return to their homes. Every platoon made
        a daily patrol and hunted for people, whoever was found was shot on the spot.</p>
      <p>There came another order on the second day. Everything gone. Tones will be burned down.
        Everything must be cleared by 5 o'clock in the morning. Anyone found after 6 a.m. will be
        shot. I was on guard duty at 12 o'clock at night. It was a misery. At 4.30 a.m. I was
        awakened by two other reservists. They told me to come immediately, there were still people
        in one house. You can do a little</p>
      <p>I got dressed quite quickly. I put on my rifle. When I arrived at the house, three women
        and a 4-year-old boy were standing in front of me, all crying. I greeted them and said stop!
        You must leave in any case. There were 4 generations. The grandmother, mother, daughter and
        her child.</p>
      <p>I heard the grandmother say: he is a good man, we want to be shot by his hand, they did not
        want to live anymore, because they would lose everything. Even the house. I was speechless,
        because I had never heard such a request. As I stood there the old woman said, </p>
      <pb n="6" facs="EHRI-TS-19640206-A_06.jpg"/>
      <p>He doesn&#x2019;t understand us&#x201D;, so I pulled myself together and said: I understand very well. It
        would not have required any knowledge of the language. The grandmother explained to me with
        signs: she points to my rifle, then to her heart, on and on in that order to a heart and to
        my rifle. The crying little boy would have been the last to go. The time was pressing at any
        moment the active beasts could appear. You have to act quickly. There was a big sleigh in
        front of the house. Quickly put all the laundry bundles on it, put little Iwan on one of
        those, with two ends of the bundle knotted over his belly so that he wouldn&#x2019;t fall off.</p>
      <p>Cheered up, the woman pushed myself along, and into the forest with the sledge. And I said,
        go to Durow. They were saved.</p>
      <p>On the other side of the village an active shot a woman who could leave the house no
        longer, because she was heavily pregnant and could give birth to a child at any moment,
        finished off by a rifle shot in the abdomen and leave this woman lying in her blood.</p>
      <p>At the same time, this guy himself had a wife and a child at home. Half an hour later Tonec
        was a sea of flames. We moved back to Durow to await further orders. In this way countless
        villages were razed to the ground in the whole <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pripyat">Prypez</ref>-Sludin area.</p>
