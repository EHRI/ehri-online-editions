                <p>Testimony of Johanna Frankel, a non-Jew “with some Jewish blood”, who first married to a non-Jew with a daughter born in 1920. She
                    later married a Jew who had been in Buchenwald but emigrated to the UK in 1939. She describes discrimination at work. Frankel
                    unsuccessfully applied for exemption from wearing the yellow star. She divorced her husband to escape deportation. They remarried
                    in London after the war.</p>

                    unable to get all the necessary <term ref="#t1142" type="subject">papers</term>.</p>
                <p>At the outbreak of <term ref="#t1080" type="subject">war</term> Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri"
                        >Fraenkel</persName> was thus left in <placeName ref="#frankfurt-am-main" type="ehri">Frankfurt-am-Main</placeName>, the
                    (mainly) gentile <term ref="#t825" type="subject">wife</term> of a Jew, living with her 19 year old gentile daughter from her

                <p>Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> had been employed by <orgName
                        ref="#ehri_et_voigt_u_heffner" type="ehri">Voigt u. Heffner</orgName>, <term ref="#t923" type="subject"><foreign xml:lang="de"

                        ref="#t375" type="subject">marriage</term> in <date when="1928-04">April</date>, preferring to leave before being thrown out.
                    On the occasion of her leaving, her colleagues gave her a present. This was accompanied by a list of the subscribers to the
                    present, with their signatures. Several <term ref="#t1179" type="subject">Nazi party</term> members were amongst the signatories.
                    After it had been presented, Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> was visited by a
                    representative of the employees and asked to return the list. However, she had it photocopied before returning it.</p>
                <p>In <date when="1940">1940</date> Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> obtained employment
                    with Geb. Roever, <term ref="#t923" type="subject"><foreign xml:lang="de">Aktiengesellschaft</foreign></term>. This gentile <term
                        ref="#t924" type="subject">firm</term> employed many Jews in separate and <term ref="#t332" type="subject">inferior</term>
                    departments to the gentile <term ref="#t1057" type="subject">workers</term>. They also received smaller remuneration. Mrs
                        <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName>, as <q><term ref="#t374" type="subject"><foreign
                                xml:lang="de">Mischling</foreign></term></q>, was, at first, allowed to <term ref="#t943" type="subject">work</term>
                    together with the gentiles. However, there was an <orgName ref="#g358" type="ehri">SA</orgName> control. Mrs <persName
                        ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName>, who has presumably been denounced by one of her colleagues,
                    was asked by an <orgName ref="#g358" type="ehri">SA man</orgName> how much she <term ref="#t934" type="subject">earned</term>. An
                    unpleasant scene ensued and Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> was transferred to the
                        <term ref="#t943" type="subject">sewing department</term> with the full-Jews, where she <term ref="#t934" type="subject"
                        >earned</term> considerably less.</p>
                <p>When the <term ref="#t337" type="subject">regulation</term> first came into existence, according to which Jews were forced to wear
                    a <term ref="#t338" type="subject">yellow star</term>, Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri"
                        >Fraenkel</persName> made an application through her <term ref="#t899" type="subject">lawyer</term> to the <orgName
                        ref="#g006363" type="ehri">Ministry of the Interior</orgName>, in which she maintained that she did not have to wear a <term
                        ref="#t338" type="subject">star</term>, in spite of her <term ref="#t375" type="subject">re-marriage</term>. She based this on
                    a clause in the <term ref="#t337" type="subject">regulation</term> which stated that <q><term ref="#t375" type="subject">Jews
                            married to gentiles</term>, whose <term ref="#t824" type="subject">children</term> had a <term ref="#t764" type="subject"
                            >Christian</term> up-bringing, need not wear the <term ref="#t338" type="subject">star</term>, even if the <term
                            ref="#t375" type="subject">marriage</term> had been dissolved.</q></p>
                <pb facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560044_03.jpg" n="3"/>
                <p>There was a time-lapse of three months while her <foreign xml:lang="de">applicatiogestagestn</foreign> was being considered.
                    Meanwhile Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> did not wear the <term ref="#t338"
                        type="subject">star</term> and therefore did not suffer the resulting loss of privilege (smaller <term ref="#t834"
                        type="subject">rations</term> etc). After three months, Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri"
                        >Fraenkel</persName> was summoned to the <orgName ref="#g350" type="ehri">Gestapo</orgName> H.Q. in Lindenstrasse. Here, after
                    a two hour wait, during which a <orgName ref="#g350" type="ehri">Gestapo</orgName> official accosted and insulted her in the
                    corridor, Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> was interviewed by a <orgName ref="#g350"
                        type="ehri">Gestapo</orgName> official, <persName ref="#ehri_et_schmidt" type="ehri">Schmidt</persName> who seemed to have
                    more humanity than most of his colleagues. However, he told her that he had received <term ref="#t337" type="subject"
                        >orders</term> from the <orgName ref="#g006363" type="ehri">Ministry of the Interior</orgName> that she had, in future, to
                    wear the <term ref="#t338" type="subject">star</term>. During the interview, the <orgName ref="#g350" type="ehri"
                        >Gestapo</orgName> Commissar entered, shouted at her and told her she would be sent to <term ref="#t652" type="subject"
                        >prison</term> and <term ref="#t662" type="subject">deported</term>. Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri"
                        >Fraenkel</persName> answered very quietly and the Commissar left without taking any further action. Meanwhile, at another
                    table in the same room, another <q><term ref="#t374" type="subject"><foreign xml:lang="de">Mischling</foreign></term></q> was
                    being interviewed. Her <term ref="#t108" type="subject">children</term> had had a <term ref="#t878" type="subject">Jewish
                        education</term>. Suddenly the doors were flung open and a <orgName ref="#g350" type="ehri">Gestapo</orgName> officer yelled:
                        <q>Any more for <term ref="#t669" type="subject">prison</term>?</q> and the <term ref="#t825" type="subject">woman</term> was

                <p>Before allowing Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> to leave, <persName
                        ref="#ehri_et_schmidt" type="ehri">Schmidt</persName> asked her to send her father to his office, as he, too, now had to wear

                    asked whether anything would happen to him, and <persName ref="#ehri_et_schmidt" type="ehri">Schmidt</persName> assured her that
                    he would be sent back. Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> asked whether she could not
                    simply give her father the message, and <persName ref="#ehri_et_schmidt" type="ehri">Schmidt</persName> finally agreed to her

                <p>The first two <term ref="#t521" type="subject">transports</term>, consisting only of full Jews, had left <placeName

                <p>In <date when="1942-05">May, 1942</date>, Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> was leaving
                    her <term ref="#t837" type="subject">home</term> when she met an officer from the <term ref="#t872" type="subject">Jewish
                        Community</term> of <placeName ref="#frankfurt-am-main" type="ehri">Frankfurt</placeName> entering the <term ref="#t837"
                        type="subject">house</term>. As the <term ref="#t872" type="subject">Community</term> had to compile the lists for the <term
                        ref="#t521" type="subject">transports</term> and had to break the news to the <term ref="#t519" type="subject"
                        >deportees</term>, Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName>
                    <term ref="#t829" type="subject">feared</term> the worst. Indeed, she was on the list of the next <term ref="#t521" type="subject"
                        >transport</term>. She went immediately to see the lawyer, who represented the <term ref="#t872" type="subject">Jewish
                        Community</term> and who happened to be a relative of Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri"
                        >Fraenkel</persName>. The lawyer suggested that the only way to <term ref="#t204" type="subject">escape</term>
                    <term ref="#t518" type="subject">deportation</term> was to <term ref="#t375" type="subject">divorce her Jewish husband</term>. Mrs
                        <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel's</persName> brother there upon went to <orgName ref="#g350"
                        type="ehri">Gestapo</orgName> H.Q. where he was told that if <term ref="#t375" type="subject">divorce</term> proceedings had
                    been started by that same afternoon, Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> would not be
                        <term ref="#t518" type="subject">deported</term>. The rest of the day was spent in running from office to office (Jews were,
                    of course, <term ref="#t332" type="subject">not allowed</term> to use public transport) until a document was obtained stating
                    officially that proceedings had been begun. Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> then
                    took this to the <orgName ref="#g350" type="ehri">Gestapo</orgName> who, at first refused to accept it and asked why she had
                    waited until the last moment to begin proceedings and why she had <term ref="#t375" type="subject">married</term>
                    <pb facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560044_04.jpg" n="4"/> a Jew in the first place. Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri"
                        >Fraenkel</persName> answered that if they (the <orgName ref="#g350" type="ehri">Gestapo</orgName>) had any humanity
                            (<q><foreign xml:lang="de">Menschliches Verstaendnis</foreign></q>) at all, they would understand that she wanted to give
                    her daughter a <term ref="#t837" type="subject">home</term> and had <term ref="#t375" type="subject">married</term> for her sake.
                    This evidently had some effect on the <orgName ref="#g350" type="ehri">Gestapo</orgName> officers who passed Mrs <persName
                        ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel's</persName> application not to be <term ref="#t518" type="subject"
                        >deported</term>, <q>not because of the divorce, but because we do have humanity.</q></p>
                <p>The next morning, a <orgName ref="#g350" type="ehri">Gestapo</orgName> man came to collect her for the <term ref="#t521"
                        type="subject">transport</term>. She told him that she was not to go. The <orgName ref="#g350" type="ehri">Gestapo</orgName>
                    <term ref="#t826" type="subject">man</term> left to get in touch with <orgName ref="#g350" type="ehri">H.Q.</orgName>, telling Mrs

                    be taken. He did not return, and so Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName>
                    <term ref="#t204" type="subject">escaped</term> almost certain <term ref="#t745" type="subject">death</term>. For nothing was ever
                    heard again from anyone who left on this <term ref="#t521" type="subject">transport</term>. Amongst other of her acquaintances who
                    were taken away on this <term ref="#t521" type="subject">transport</term> was an <persName ref="#ehri_et_stern_eduard" type="ehri"

                    was kept in existence after the dissolution of all the others. To be sent to the Hermesweg home meant certain <term ref="#t518"

                        ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel's</persName> uncle, was also sent to <placeName ref="#l449" type="camp"
                        >Theresienstadt</placeName>. He was also 67 years old. He wrote from the <placeName ref="#l449" type="camp">camp</placeName>,
                    telling Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> in veiled terms that <persName
                        ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_hermann" type="ehri">Hermann Fraenkel</persName> was <term ref="#t745" type="subject">dead</term>.</p>
                <p>At this time the <term ref="#t872" type="subject">Jewish Community</term> asked <q><term ref="#t374" type="subject"><foreign

                        >deportees</term> at the collecting centre. Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName>
                    volunteered and continued to do this until the last <term ref="#t521" type="subject">transport</term> in <date when="1945"
                        >1945</date>. The <term ref="#t519" type="subject">deportees</term> slept for one night at the centre. In the morning there

                        >stole</term> what they happened to fancy from the luggage. Next, by lorry to the station, where they were herded into the

                        type="ehri">Gestapo</orgName> officials walked through the <term ref="#t522" type="subject">trains</term> and <term

                <p>Summary.</p>
                <p>In all, Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna" type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> was remarkably untouched throughout this
                    period. She suffered the deprivations expected in <term ref="#t1080" type="subject">war-time</term>, accentuated by her <term
                        ref="#t338" type="subject">yellow star</term>. Her main recollection is of constant nervous strain, of constant <term
                        ref="#t196" type="subject">fear for her friends and relatives</term>; of stories of terror and brutality, of constant attempts
                    to <term ref="#t555" type="subject">humiliate</term>
                    <pb facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560044_05.jpg" n="5"/> her and her Jewish friends and relatives. But apart from petty persecutions at <term
                        ref="#t943" type="subject">work</term> and verbal insults from Nazis, Mrs <persName ref="#ehri_et_fraenkel_johanna"
                        type="ehri">Fraenkel</persName> never once witnessed actual <term ref="#t345" type="subject">physical brutality</term>, in
                    spite of the fact that after <date when="1942">1942</date> she spent a great deal of time with the <term ref="#t519"
                        type="subject">deportees</term> and their <orgName ref="#g350" type="ehri">Gestapo</orgName>
                    <term ref="#t480" type="subject">guards</term>.</p>
                <p>After the <term ref="#t1080" type="subject">war</term> she joined her <q>divorced</q> husband in <placeName ref="#london"
