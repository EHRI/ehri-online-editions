                <p>Testimony of “Miss X”, whose mother was “Aryan” and whose father was Jewish. Her parents divorced for personal reasons and her
                    mother married an “Aryan”. She describes her school, not being allowed to go to university, having to absolve a “Pflichtjahr”, a
                    year of compulsory work introduced by the Nazis, and the bureaucracy around being a “Mischling”. She was taken to a forced labor
                    camp outside Breslau to dig defense ditches, where however nobody worked very hard.</p>

                <p>Miss X</p>
                <p>First of all I should like to point out that in some respects my story is not a typical one. The fact that I was living in an
                    entirely non-Jewish household, am of <q>Nordic</q> appearance, and was <term ref="#t744" type="subject">converted</term> in <date
                        when="1933-06">June 1933</date> from my <term ref="#t822" type="subject">father’s</term> Jewish to my <term ref="#t822"
                        type="subject">mother’s</term>
                    <term ref="#t770" type="subject">Protestant</term>
                    <term ref="#t724" type="subject">faith</term> probably saved me a great deal of unpleasantness. Neither my <term ref="#t822"
                        type="subject">father</term> nor my <term ref="#t822" type="subject">mother</term> are strict in their respective <term
                        ref="#t724" type="subject">religions</term>, and my early <term ref="#t724" type="subject">religious</term> upbringing had
                    been correspondingly liberal; so that the <term ref="#t742" type="subject">conversion</term> itself, as far as I can remember,
                    made little impression on me. The practical significance, however, became soon apparent:</p>
                <p>At that time I attended a private <term ref="#t1134" type="subject">school</term> with a large number of Jewish pupils. Towards the
                    end of <date when="1933">1933</date> the <term ref="#t1134" type="subject">classes</term> were separated into a <term ref="#t763"
                        type="subject">Christian</term> and a Jewish section. This was done, I believe, not on official <term ref="#t951"
                        type="subject">orders</term>, but the initiative of the Headmaster. I was at first put into the Jewish section. It was the
                    first time that I was made to realize the problem of my <term ref="#t648" type="subject">part-Jewish</term> parentage, and I
                    remember that I was very upset. My <term ref="#t822" type="subject">mother</term> protested to the Headmaster, and I was
                    transferred to the <term ref="#t763" type="subject">Christian</term> section.</p>
                <p>Apart from this incident, my <term ref="#t1134" type="subject">school-life</term> was quite happy when I was twelve I changed over
                    to a <q><term ref="#t1134" type="subject">Lyzeum</term></q>. The <term ref="#t1134" type="subject">school</term> kept as far as
                    possible to its liberal traditions. The teachers showed no <term ref="#t332" type="subject">discrimination</term> against me,
                    although they all learned sooner or later that I was <term ref="#t374" type="subject">half-Jewish</term>. In fact, at a time when
                    my <term ref="#t943" type="subject">work</term> was seriously affected by <term ref="#t196" type="subject">worry</term> about my
                        <term ref="#t822" type="subject">father</term> in <placeName ref="#london" type="ehri">London</placeName>, my Latin mistress
                    went out of her way to be sympathetic and helpful. There was only one master who evidenced animosity towards me, and I have no
                    doubt this was from <term ref="#t328" type="subject">racial prejudice</term>.</p>
                <pb facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560023_03.jpg" n="3"/>
                <p>In such lessons as <placeName ref="#federal-republic-of-germany" type="ehri">German</placeName>, history and geography we were
                    taught an exaggerated patriotism rather than specifically <term ref="#t381" type="subject">National Socialist</term> doctrines. I
                    cannot recall any direct anti-Jewish observations Jewish achievements were simply not mentioned. The names of Spinoza, Ehrlich,
                    Offenbach and Einstein - to gave but a few examples - were unknown to me until I came to <placeName ref="#england" type="ehri"
                        >England</placeName> after the <term ref="#t1080" type="subject">war</term>.</p>
                <p>I was the only <q>non-<term ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryan</term></q> in my <term ref="#t1134" type="subject">class</term>. There
                    were some other <term ref="#t374" type="subject">half-Jewish</term> girls in the <term ref="#t1134" type="subject">school</term>
                    and I learnt from hearsay that their position was sometimes difficult. Personally, I can only say that I was always on excellent
                    terms with my class-mates. My <term ref="#t1134" type="subject">class</term> may have been exceptional in that it contained not a
                    single ardent Nazi. At first my fellow pupils did not know of being <term ref="#t374" type="subject">half-Jewish</term>. When
                    somebody told them they decided, as I learnt later, to hide their knowledge from me in order to spare me any embarrassment. We
                    were altogether not greatly interested in <term ref="#t947" type="subject">politics</term>.</p>
                <p>I passed my <q><term ref="#t842" type="subject">Abitur</term></q> in <date when="1941">1941</date>, the last year when <q>non-<term
                            ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryans</term></q> were allowed to do so. It was then that I was faced with my first real
                    difficulties.</p>
                <p><term ref="#t947" type="subject">Politics</term> had entered into my home life earlier and more forcefully. My <term ref="#t822"
                        type="subject">mother</term> was a violent <term ref="#t178" type="subject">anti-Nazi</term>. She talked very freely, and I
                    was in constant fear that she would be <term ref="#t598" type="subject">arrested</term>. My <term ref="#t822" type="subject"
                        >step-father</term> was a Nazi of the idealistic type, who expected wonderful things of the <term ref="#t1159" type="subject"
                        >Third <foreign xml:lang="de">Reich</foreign></term>. There were frequent and sometimes rather violent political arguments
                    between him and my <term ref="#t822" type="subject">mother</term>. About Jews he seemed to have no strong feelings either for and
                    against, and he always treated me as if were his own daughter. He had been a <term ref="#t360" type="subject">Party member</term>,
                    but although he had been told that the <term ref="#t360" type="subject">Party</term> would not object to his <term ref="#t741"
                        type="subject">marrying</term> the former wife of a Jew, and <term ref="#t822" type="subject">mother</term> of a <term
                        ref="#t374" type="subject">half-Jewish</term>
                    <term ref="#t824" type="subject">child</term>, he was afterwards put under pressure to leave the <term ref="#t360" type="subject"
                        >Party</term>. My presence caused a number of problems, especially after the outbreak of <term ref="#t1080" type="subject"
                        >war</term>. I particularly remember the problem of ration stamps:</p>
                <p>As a rule, <term ref="#t834" type="subject">ration</term> stamps were distributed into the households by the street warden; but
                    Jews and non-<term ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryans</term> had to collect them personally from a special Centre. This applied
                    also to every member of a household which contained a non-<term ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryan</term>. To be seen regularly at
                    this Centre for Jews and non-<term ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryans</term> would have gravely endangered my <term ref="#t822"
                        type="subject">step-father’s</term> position in the <term ref="#t943" type="subject">firm</term> which <term ref="#t943"
                        type="subject">employed</term> him. He finally managed to obtain dispensation from the <term ref="#t951" type="subject"
                        >rule</term>, but we were still obliged to collect our <term ref="#t834" type="subject">ration</term> stamps</p>
                <pb facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560023_04.jpg" n="4"/>
                <p>from the <term ref="#t832" type="subject">Food</term> Office direct, and were not granted occasional extra <term ref="#t834"
                        type="subject">rations</term> like the rest of the population. This and similar difficulties are trifling in retrospect, but
                    seemed very important at the time and made me disturbingly aware of my inferior status in the <term ref="#t1159" type="subject"
                        >Third <foreign xml:lang="de">Reich</foreign></term>.</p>
                <p>This feeling increased with the problems which arose on my leaving <term ref="#t1134" type="subject">school</term>. I had set my
                    heart on a <term ref="#t1134" type="subject">University</term>
                    <term ref="#t842" type="subject">education</term>, but one could not be enrolled at a <term ref="#t1134" type="subject"
                        >Univerity</term> before having completed the six months’s <term ref="#t943" type="subject">Labour Service</term> (<q><foreign
                            xml:lang="de">Arbeitsdienst</foreign></q>), from which <q>non-<term ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryans</term></q> were
                    excluded. Instead, we had to complete a Year of Duty (<q><foreign xml:lang="de">Pflichtjahr</foreign></q> at some place where
                    there was urgent need for a servant, as in <term ref="#t819" type="subject">families</term> with many <term ref="#t824"
                        type="subject">children</term>. In my first service of this kind I did not mention that I was <term ref="#t374" type="subject"
                        >half-Jewish</term>; when my <term ref="#t943" type="subject">employer</term> was informed of it, I was <term ref="#t665"
                        type="subject">dismissed</term>. I finished my Year of Duty in the service of the wife of a <term ref="#t770" type="subject"
                        >Protestant</term>
                    <term ref="#t731" type="subject">cleric</term>, <foreign xml:lang="de">Kirchenrätin Viebig</foreign>. She was markedly pro-Jewish,
                    keeping up contact, at great risk to herself, with her Jewish friends until these were <term ref="#t518" type="subject"
                        >deported</term>. I was treated more as a friend of the <term ref="#t837" type="subject">house</term> than as a servant.
                    During that time 9 made several further application for admittance into the <term ref="#t943" type="subject">Labour
                    Service</term>. I even went so far as to suggest that I was the illegitimate <term ref="#t824" type="subject">child</term> of an
                            <q><term ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryan</term></q>
                    <term ref="#t822" type="subject">father</term>. I did not succeed.</p>
                <p>I felt very bitter about the whole situation in a quite childishly self-centred way. I blamed my <term ref="#t822" type="subject"
                        >mother</term> for having <term ref="#t375" type="subject">married</term> a Jew, and several times even told her so to her
                    face. It was not that I experienced any conflict of loyalties or felt <q>tainted</q> by my Jewish blood. I simply resented the
                    fact that I was under a special handicap; most of all, that I could not start a career to which I felt my talents and <term
                        ref="#t842" type="subject">education</term> entitled me. Inconsistently, perhaps, this did not affect feelings towards my
                        <term ref="#t822" type="subject">father</term>. I had always been on most affectionate terms with him. From the time when my
                    parents separated up to the time of his <term ref="#t203" type="subject">emigration</term> I had visited him regularly. Shortly
                    before the outbreak of <term ref="#t1080" type="subject">war</term> I spent a holidays with him in <placeName ref="#london"
                        type="ehri">London</placeName>, and even considered for a while joining him there permanently. All through the <term
                        ref="#t1080" type="subject">war</term> I tried to obtain news from him though the <orgName ref="#g419" type="ehri">Red
                        Cross</orgName>.</p>
                <p>My social relations with other young people were less problematic than the official <term ref="#t332" type="subject"
                        >discrimination</term> against <q>non-<term ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryans</term></q> would lead one to expect. None of my
                    old friends changed her or his attitude. Whenever I met a young <term ref="#t826" type="subject">man</term> who seemed to take an
                    illegible interest in me I told him at once that I was <term ref="#t374" type="subject">half-Jewish</term>. I rather enjoyed the
                    special implications. I considered such firendships and flirtations as proof that my personal attractions were</p>
                <pb facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560023_05.jpg" n="5"/>
                <p>stronger than the influence of official disapproval. Generally speaking, I found that at least in the circles in which I moved the
                    younger generation took <term ref="#t367" type="subject">Nazi doctrines</term> far less seriously than their elders. The interest
                    of my friends was mainly limited to their personal affairs; they were rather cynical in their attitude to <term ref="#t947"
                        type="subject">politics</term> and the <term ref="#t1080" type="subject">war</term>.</p>
                <p>The one exception I remember was, curiously enough, a <placeName ref="#czechia" type="ehri">Czech</placeName> with whom I formed a
                    serious attachment. He had pronounced <term ref="#t340" type="subject">anti-Jewish</term> feeling, and at first I could not find
                    the moral courage to tell him that my <term ref="#t822" type="subject">father</term> was Jewish. When I told him eventually, he
                    got over the shock after having wrestled with the problem, as he told me, for a whole sleepless night. Our friendship continued,
                    and at one stage we seriously considered <term ref="#t741" type="subject">marrying</term>. This brought <term ref="#t837"
                        type="subject">home</term> to me the paradox of my position in regard to <term ref="#t741" type="subject">marriage</term>: as
                    a <q>non-<term ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryan</term></q> I could <term ref="#t741" type="subject">marry</term> neither a Jew nor
                    an <q><term ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryan</term></q> without special permission; and as a <placeName
                        ref="#federal-republic-of-germany" type="ehri">German</placeName> I was not allowed to <term ref="#t741" type="subject"
                        >marry</term>, or have intimate relations with, a <term ref="#t826" type="subject">man</term> of <q>inferior</q>
                    <term ref="#t1149" type="subject">foreign nationality</term>. In fact, I was frequently warned that I had been seen in the company
                    of this <placeName ref="#czechia" type="ehri">Czech</placeName>, and that this might get me into trouble.</p>
                <p>It did not come to a formal application for permission to <term ref="#t741" type="subject">marry</term>, but once I made a general
                    enquiry as to my chances of being allowed to <term ref="#t741" type="subject">marry</term> an <q><term ref="#t373" type="subject"
                            >Aryan</term></q>. The official in charge of <q>non-<term ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryan</term></q> affairs in
                        <placeName ref="#wroclaw" type="ehri">Breslau</placeName> told me that my chances were fairly good, since neither my <term
                        ref="#t822" type="subject">father</term> himself nor a member of his <term ref="#t819" type="subject">family</term> had
                    received a <term ref="#t1134" type="subject">University</term>
                    <term ref="#t842" type="subject">education</term>; thus there was little risk of my transmitting <q>Jewish <term ref="#t1090"
                            type="subject">intelligence</term></q> to my <term ref="#t824" type="subject">children</term>. On that occasion I learnt
                    that a strict watch was kept on all <q>non-<term ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryans</term></q>. The official knew practically
                    everything about my <term ref="#t819" type="subject">family</term> affairs, <term ref="#t943" type="subject">work</term>,
                    friendships etc.</p>
                <p>After the completion of my <q><term ref="#t943" type="subject">Year of Duty</term></q> I found it difficult, as a <term ref="#t374"
                        type="subject">half-Jewess</term>, to find suitable <term ref="#t943" type="subject">employment</term>. I was not allowed to
                    finish a course in shorthand-typing at the [<q><term ref="#t1134" type="subject"><foreign xml:lang="de">Städtische
                                Handelsschule</foreign></term></q>]. I had to leave a congenial position as <term ref="#t943" type="subject">shop
                        assistant</term> in a music shop, because <q>non-<term ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryans</term></q> were forbidden <term
                        ref="#t943" type="subject">employment</term> which would bring them into contact with the general public. I applied for a
                        <term ref="#t943" type="subject">job</term> in a <term ref="#t929" type="subject">factory</term> owned by an old friend of my
                        <term ref="#t822" type="subject">father's</term>. At first he did not dare take me on because, having a <q>non-<term
                            ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryan</term></q> wife, he was himself in a delicate position. But when I was sent to him a
                    little later through the official <term ref="#t943" type="subject">employment</term> exchange, he engaged me as a <term
                        ref="#t943" type="subject">typist</term>. I had no difficulties with my <term ref="#t943" type="subject">fellow-workers</term>
                    in the office.</p>
                <p>In <date when="1944-08">August 1944</date> I was drafted into a <term ref="#t508" type="subject">labour camp</term> of the</p>
                <pb facs="EHRI-ET-WL16560023_06.jpg" n="6"/>
                <p><foreign xml:lang="de"><orgName ref="#g433" type="ehri">Organisation Todt</orgName></foreign>, <q><foreign xml:lang="de"
                            >Unternehmen</foreign> Berthold</q>, about 20 miles from <placeName ref="#wroclaw" type="ehri">Breslau</placeName>. We
                    numbered approximately 150 <term ref="#t825" type="subject">girls</term>, for the greater part <term ref="#t824" type="subject"
                        >children</term> of mixed <term ref="#t741" type="subject">marriages</term>, like myself (though there were also some <q><term
                            ref="#t373" type="subject">Aryan</term></q> and a few Jewesses who somehow had <term ref="#t204" type="subject"
                        >escaped</term>
                    <term ref="#t598" type="subject">arrest</term> and <term ref="#t518" type="subject">deportation</term> before them). divided into
                    5 groups. Some <q>Nordic</q>-looking <term ref="#t825" type="subject">girls</term>, including myself, were picked out to be group
                    leaders.</p>
                <p>We were made to dig fortifications, but supervision was rather lax and we did not overwork ourselves. Our <term ref="#t837"
                        type="subject">accommodation</term>, first in a <term ref="#t837" type="subject">barn</term>, later on the dance floor of a
                    country <term ref="#t837" type="subject">inn</term>, was primitive, the <term ref="#t832" type="subject">food</term> bad and
                    insufficient, and the <term ref="#t295" type="subject">sanitary</term> arrangements shocking. Our guards, <term ref="#t1091"
                        type="subject">uniformed</term> members of the <q><orgName ref="#g433" type="ehri"><foreign xml:lang="de">Organisation
                                Todt</foreign></orgName></q> were unpleasant, but there was no physical <term ref="#t345" type="subject"
                        >violence</term>. Frequent <term ref="#t345" type="subject">beatings</term>, however, occurred in the <term ref="#t507"
                        type="subject">men’s camp</term> near-by, as we learnt from the <term ref="#t826" type="subject">men</term> when we met them
                    at <term ref="#t943" type="subject">work</term>. Our daily <term ref="#t487" type="subject">roll calls</term> were perfunctory,
                    and some of us went several times secretly to <placeName ref="#wroclaw" type="ehri">Breslau</placeName> for a day. We did not try
                    to <term ref="#t204" type="subject">escape</term> altogether, as we feared that reprisals would be taken against those left
                    behind.</p>
                <p>Almost from the beginning we developed a strong spirit of solidarity. Personally, I acquired for the first time a positive attitude
                    towards the Jewish part of my life. Previously I had felt the kind of <q>Jewish <term ref="#t329" type="subject"
                            >antisemitism</term></q> which, I believe, was often found in some sections of <placeName
                        ref="#federal-republic-of-germany" type="ehri">German</placeName> Jewry. This feeling I lost completely through the intimate
                    contact with the other <term ref="#t483" type="subject">camp inmates</term>, some of whom had physically and mentally strong
                    Jewish characteristics. Without that experience, I doubt that later on I would have made the decision to <term ref="#t203"
                        type="subject">emigrate</term> to <placeName ref="#england" type="ehri">England</placeName> and live with my <term ref="#t822"
                        type="subject">father</term>.</p>
                <p>Some <term ref="#t825" type="subject">girls</term> - very few - tried to curry favour with the <term ref="#t480" type="subject"
                        >guards</term> and slept with them. They were boycotted by the rest of us. Their behaviour was considered treacherous. There
                    was no objection to <term ref="#t838" type="subject">sexual</term> misbehaviour, as such including <term ref="#t859"
                        type="subject">Lesbian</term> practices, of which there was a great deal. Generally speaking, the outlook on <term ref="#t838"
                        type="subject">sexual</term> behaviour amongst my contemporaries had become completely cynical under the Nazi regime,
                    especially during the <term ref="#t1080" type="subject">war</term>.</p>
                <p>When towards the end of the <term ref="#t1080" type="subject">war</term> the <orgName ref="#g004583" type="ehri">Russian
                        army</orgName> had advanced to within hearing distance of our <term ref="#t567" type="subject">camp</term>, I and a number of
                    other <term ref="#t825" type="subject">girls</term> made our <term ref="#t204" type="subject">escape</term>. This was not
                    difficult, as by that time the <term ref="#t480" type="subject">guards</term> were already demoralised and hardly tried to
                    maintain control.</p>
