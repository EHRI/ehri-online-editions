                <p>trick was obvious. By this bait the <orgName ref="#g429" type="ehri">SS</orgName> wanted to entice our <term ref="#t822"

                    <term ref="#t522" type="subject">train</term> they employed diabolical methods like these to deceive people about their fate in

                    and notice the change in the mental atmosphere of the <term ref="#t483" type="subject">inmates</term>. The same method was
                    employed on many occasions all over the eastern <term ref="#t567" type="subject">camps</term>. That accounts for the numerous

                <p>The Hangman. After a journey of three days and two nights the <term ref="#t522" type="subject">train</term> arrived at a railway
                    siding on <date when="1944-09-29">29th September 1944</date>. It was dark, about 9 p.m., but though we could not see the name of
                    the station we guessed we were in the notorious <placeName ref="#l0" type="camp">Oswiecim (Auschwitz) camp</placeName>. We were
                    dragged out of the <term ref="#t522" type="subject">wagons</term> by <term ref="#t650" type="subject">prisoners</term> and not
                    allowed to take our luggage with us. It was looted afterwards, and even the small rations we had were stolen by the old <term

                    <term ref="#t483" type="subject">inmates</term>.</p>
                <p>We were formed into files and had to pass an <orgName ref="#g429" type="ehri">SS</orgName> officer – most probably an <orgName
                        ref="#g429" type="ehri">SS</orgName>
                    <term ref="#t287" type="subject">doctor</term>. He sat on a chair, three yards away from us, with legs outstretched in a
                        half ??<note place="bottom">Text unclear</note> position, almost motionless. The only part of his body which he moved was the
                        <term ref="#t411" type="subject">thumb</term> of his right hand. With this he pointed either to the left or to the right as a
                    man stood in front of him. He did not utter a single word. We had been ordered to answer three questions: What age, what
                    occupation, in what state of health. I answered: 27 – metal worker – fit. The <orgName ref="#g429" type="ehri">SS</orgName>
                    officer thumbed me to the right.</p>
                <p>After this <term ref="#t411" type="subject">sorting</term> of human beings 1600 <term ref="#t826" type="subject">men</term> found
                    themselves on the right, 900 on the left. Not everybody had declared himself fit. Was this not after all a <term ref="#t943"
                        type="subject">working</term> detachment? The very word seemed to indicate that there were different kinds of <term

                        type="subject">men</term>. Thus some of the parded <term ref="#t826" type="subject">men</term> may have explained that they
                    were suffering from complaints preventing them from doing too heavy <term ref="#t943" type="subject">work</term>. Others gave
                    themselves away by their grey hair, though the whole detachment consisted of <term ref="#t826" type="subject">men</term> of <term
                        ref="#t1076" type="subject">military</term> age. This latter fact explains why so <q>few</q> were directed to the left. As I
                    heard afterwards the usual percentage of people <term ref="#t411" type="subject">selected</term> for <term ref="#t532"

                <p>While queuing in front of our hangman we saw flames arising from the chimneys of several buildings, and were told by the old timers

                <p>During the whole night we had to stand in a stable. Then we had to strip and to give up everything, including our wedding rings,
                    except our belts, spectacles and shoes. We were next led into a bath-house where our heads were shaved and we had to take a

                        ref="#t943" type="subject">work</term> detachment <placeName ref="#l16" type="camp">Gleiwitz I</placeName>
                    <placeName ref="#l17" type="camp">and II</placeName> were <term ref="#t745" type="subject">shot down</term> and <term ref="#t745"
                        type="subject">died</term> by the roadside like hunted animals. I stress this fact purposely because I want to emphasise that
                    the whole responsibility for the <term ref="#t532" type="subject">murder</term> of my poor fellow-<term ref="#t650" type="subject"
                        >prisoners</term> lies with the Commanding <orgName ref="#g429" type="ehri">SS</orgName> Officers. Where no orders to <term
                        ref="#t540" type="subject">massacre</term> were given, as in the case of <persName ref="#ehri_et_spicker_f" type="ehri"
                        >Spicker</persName>, no one was <term ref="#t745" type="subject">shot</term>.</p>
                <p>We were <term ref="#t517" type="subject">marched</term> back to <placeName ref="#l7" type="camp">Blechhammer</placeName> on our way
                    to <placeName ref="#l18" type="camp">Gleiwitz III</placeName>. On the <date when="1945-01-21">21 Jan. 1945</date> I noticed that
                    some of the <orgName ref="#g429" type="ehri">SS</orgName>
                    <term ref="#t480" type="subject">Guards of the camp</term> had left their posts, when I was pushed out of the gates by the crowd
                    of fellow-<term ref="#t650" type="subject">prisoners</term>. Together with a <term ref="#t650" type="subject"
                        >fellow-prisoner</term>, Dr. <persName ref="#ehri_et_zelderust_eduard" type="ehri">Eduard Zelderust</persName>, I ran away.
                    For some days and nights we remained in the forest near <placeName ref="#l7" type="camp">Blechhammer</placeName> where we heard
                    the roar of the approaching battle. We were happy. There were machine-gun bullets and shell-fire, but we did not feel frightened.
                    Was this only due to our lack of fighting experience? In part it might have been so because we were surprised when we noticed that
                    all <term ref="#t124" type="subject">civilians</term> around us had suddenly disappeared.</p>
                <pb facs="EHRI-ET-YV3549264_12.jpg" n="12"/>
                <p>-11-</p>
                <p>It took us some time to realise that these <term ref="#t124" type="subject">people</term> had simply thrown themselves down on the
                    ground, in order to take cover, and we followed, of course, their example. But I think there was another reason for our standing
                    upright while shells and bullets whistled around us. It was impersonal <term ref="#t745" type="subject">death</term> which we here
                    encountered for the first time. The bullets and shells were not meant to end just our lives. <term ref="#t745" type="subject"
                        >Death</term>, which had been at our heels from the first day of our falling into the hands of the Nazis, death in <placeName
                        ref="#l0" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName>, was quite a different companion. In <placeName ref="#l0" type="camp"
                        >Auschwitz</placeName> we were singled out, we <term ref="#t332" type="subject">Jews</term>, defenseless, completely at the
                    mercy of the merciless. <term ref="#t745" type="subject">Death</term> was lurking at every corner ready to force us into his
                    suffocating grip. At times we even felt a desire to surrender to this greedy companion to <term ref="#t204" type="subject"
                        >escape</term> at least the daily, nay hourly, threat that he might strike us down. In <placeName ref="#l0" type="camp"
                        >Auschwitz</placeName> we had to <term ref="#t250" type="subject">resist</term> the temptation to throw ourselves against the
                    seductive electric wire and thus end our suspense. In the <placeName ref="#l7" type="camp">Blechhammer</placeName> Forest, where
                    only impersonal <term ref="#t745" type="subject">death</term> threatened, we shared a danger common to all and felt free and
                    relieved even when we realised that the shells and bullets might end our <term ref="#t204" type="subject">escape</term> into
                    life.</p>

                <p>The <orgName ref="#g004892" type="ehri">Jewish Central Information Office</orgName> has been informed by another eye-witness that,
                    after Mr. <persName ref="#ehri_et_mannheimer_max_e" type="ehri">Mannheimer</persName>'s <term ref="#t518" type="subject"

                        type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName>, and that about a total of 18,000 people were <term ref="#t623" type="subject"

                    deliberately brought into the <term ref="#t567" type="subject">camp</term> people from other <term ref="#t496" type="subject"
                        >concentration camps</term> who were infected with <term ref="#t493" type="subject">typhus</term>; some days <term ref="#t522"
                        type="subject">trains</term> arrived with up to 150 <term ref="#t515" type="subject">bodies</term> of people who had <term

                <p>When the <term ref="#t567" type="subject">camp</term> was <term ref="#t573" type="subject">liberated</term> by the <orgName
                        ref="#g004583" type="ehri">Russians</orgName> there were some 5,000 Jews from <placeName ref="#federal-republic-of-germany"
                        type="ehri">Germany</placeName> in <placeName ref="#l449" type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName>, 4,000 Jewish <term

                    partners.</p>
                <p>This eye-witness estimated that the <term ref="#t862" type="subject">death rate</term> during the maximum occupation of the <term
                        ref="#t567" type="subject">camp</term>, which he maintains was not more than 40,000, was 150 a day. He is of opinion that
                        <placeName ref="#l449" type="ghetto">Theresienstadt</placeName> was never intended to be anything more than a <term
                        ref="#t505" type="subject">transit camp</term>, irrespective of the age of the people <q>privileged</q> to live in this
