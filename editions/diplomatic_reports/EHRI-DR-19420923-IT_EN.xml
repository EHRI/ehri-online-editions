				<p>Re: New <term ref="#t542" type="subject">measures</term> against the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> in <placeName
						ref="#romania">Romania</placeName></p>
				<p><placeName ref="#romania">Romanian</placeName>authorities seem determined to solve the <term ref="#t351" type="subject">Jewish
						problem</term> with drastic <term ref="#t542" type="subject">measures</term>, <term ref="#t518" type="subject">sending</term>
					a great number of <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Semtic</term> elements to the <term ref="#t1038" type="subject">occupied</term>
					<placeName ref="#russian-federation">Russian</placeName> territories. These <term ref="#t518?dlid=deu" type="subject"
						>deportations</term> had already started during last winter and involved the <term ref="#t872" type="subject">Jews</term>
					living in <placeName ref="#bessarabia">Bessarabia</placeName> and <placeName ref="#bukovina">Bukovina</placeName>, who were
					accused of having welcomed the <term ref="#t1036" type="subject">Bolshevik occupation</term>, and those in <placeName
						ref="#republic-of-moldova">Moldavia</placeName>, who during the first days of the <term ref="#t1080" type="subject">war</term>
					had stirred up <term ref="#t1000" type="subject">Communist</term> riots in <placeName ref="#iasi">Jassy</placeName> and in
						<placeName ref="#galati">Galatz</placeName> that were immediately suppressed. The system now has been extended to other
					regions and towns, including the <placeName ref="#bucharest">capital</placeName>, where in the last few days the <term
						ref="#t1119" type="subject">police</term> have carried out vast round-ups among the Jewish element and have sent the people
					arrested beyond the <placeName ref="#dniester">Dnestr</placeName> and beyond the <placeName ref="#pivdennyy-buh">Bug</placeName>.
					There they are <term ref="#t488" type="subject">employed</term> in public works, mainly road works, but reportedly last winter
					many, due also to lack of equipment and of suitable lodgings, did not survive the long <term ref="#t517" type="subject"
						>marches</term> from one place to the other and the rigours of the <placeName ref="#russian-federation">Russian</placeName>
					winter.</p>
				<p>News of these <term ref="#t542" type="subject">measures</term> spread rapidly even abroad, causing the <placeName
						ref="#united-states">United States</placeName> to send a <term ref="#t125" type="subject">protest note</term> through the
						<orgName ref="#g1373">Swiss Legation</orgName> which here protects their interests. However, the <placeName ref="#romania"
						>Romanian</placeName>
					<term ref="#t948" type="subject">government</term>, during the last meeting of the Council of Ministers, decided <pb
						facs="EHRI-DR-19420923-IT_02.jpg" n="2"/> to ignore the American démarche and to carry on with the <term ref="#t518"
						type="subject">deportations</term>. To this end, the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> to be sent beyond the
						<placeName ref="#dniester">Dniestr</placeName> have been classed – according to a list that <placeName ref="#romania"
						>Romanian</placeName> authorities have handed to <orgName ref="#g1380">German authorities</orgName> on their request – in
					thirteen categories, namely: 1) those who when the Bolshevik invasion took place submitted an application to the local Soviet
					Legation to be allowed to move to the <placeName ref="#union-of-soviet-socialist-republics">U.R.S.S</placeName>. (the relevant
					lists were found by the <placeName ref="#romania">Romanians</placeName> in the archives of the <placeName
						ref="#russian-federation">Russian</placeName> Legation); 2) people who are in jail for being <term ref="#t1000?dlid=deu"
						type="subject">Communists</term>; 3) those who already are in <term ref="#t496" type="subject">concentration camps</term>; 4)
					those engaged in <term ref="#t199" type="subject">illegal activities</term>; 5) owners of gambling houses, gamblers, cardsharpers;
					6) <term ref="#t253" type="subject">saboteurs</term> of the <term ref="#t918" type="subject">economy</term>, that is those guilty
					of speculating and hoarding, according to information acquired by the Prefecture of <term ref="#t1119?dlid=deu" type="subject"
						>Police</term>; 7) those who are in favour of the Americans; 8) Russophiles, who oppose the war against the <placeName
						ref="#union-of-soviet-socialist-republics">Soviet Union</placeName>; 9) alarmists; 10) Hungarophiles in <placeName
						ref="#transilvania">Transylvania</placeName>, particularly in the <placeName ref="#deva">Deva</placeName> and <placeName
						ref="#arad">Arad</placeName> areas, and those who have tried to emigrate to <placeName ref="#hungary">Hungary</placeName>; 12)
					those guilty of fraudulent bankruptcy; 13) former <term ref="#t799" type="subject">journalists</term> who were employed by the
					Anglo-American news organization.</p>
				<p>The said measures are in my opinion further proof of the resolve with which the <persName ref="#p000010">Conducator’s</persName>
					regime has embraced the cause of totalitarian Nations. They will no doubt please <placeName ref="#federal-republic-of-germany"
						>Germany</placeName>, which never tires to urge <placeName ref="#romania">Romanians</placeName> to use forcefulness in <term
						ref="#t529" type="subject">eliminating</term> Jewry, but at the same time will deepen the chasm separating <persName
						ref="#p000010">Antonescu’s</persName> Romania from the democratic countries.</p>
				<p>In the country itself the <term ref="#t542" type="subject">anti-Semitic measures</term> are designed instead to do away with the
					most dangerous hotbeds of opposition and to “romanize” the vast Jewish assets, while the <pb facs="EHRI-DR-19420923-IT_03.jpg"
						n="3"/> deportation of Transylvanian Jews, who are all Hungarophiles, is aimed at strengthening the Romanian make-up of those
					contested regions.</p>
				<p>I enclose on this point the copy of a report by the R.Vice Consulate in <placeName ref="#timisoara">Timisoara</placeName>.</p>
