				<p>A <q>revivication of the <orgName ref="#g454">Iron Guard</orgName>
						<term ref="#t964" type="subject">movement</term></q> did not eventuate; rather, the legionary leaders <term ref="#t541"
						type="subject">have been shot</term> and the<term ref="#t964" type="subject"> movement’s</term> strength, both actual and
					potential, is greatly diminished. But the <term ref="#t381" type="subject">Nazi </term>shadow still looms large. Whether the <term
						ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_germans">German</term>
					<term ref="#t662" type="subject">threat</term> is a controlling or only a contributory factor, the fact is that the plight of the
						<term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> in this country has grown worse and their <term ref="#t829" type="subject"
						>fears</term> are greatly increased.</p>
				<p>The <term ref="#t948" type="subject">Government</term> can scarcely be called, as compared with the <persName ref="#p000930"
						>Goga</persName>
					<term ref="#t948" type="subject">Government</term> a year ago, strongly <term ref="#t329" type="subject">anti-Semitic</term>, but
					it ‘recognizes the existence of a <term ref="#t351" type="subject">Jewish problem</term>’ and many are constrained to feel that
					although the <persName ref="#p000930">Goga</persName> and <persName ref="#p000084">Cuza</persName> program was openly and
					violently <term ref="#t329" type="subject">anti-Jewish</term> the actual effect of the <term ref="#t337" type="subject"
						>measures</term> and methods employed by the present <term ref="#t1063" type="subject">regime</term> is more severe. It is
					true that there is no out-and-out <term ref="#t346" type="subject">pogrom</term> and that <term ref="#t948" type="subject"
						>Governmental</term>
					<term ref="#t339" type="subject">regulation of the Jews</term> is, on the surface, relatively slight, but pressure, obstacles,
						<term ref="#t332" type="subject">discriminations</term> – all of these forms of <term ref="#t642" type="subject"
						>persecution</term> are becoming noticeably more numerous. [...]</p>
				<pb facs="R 6456-27 (209).jpg" n="5"/>
				<p>The <term ref="#t815" type="subject">attitude</term> of the <orgName ref="#ehri_dr_government_romanian">Romanian
						Government</orgName> is, then, that this surplus <term ref="#t896" type="subject">population</term> of <term ref="#t1149"
						type="subject">non-citizen</term>
					<term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> must go; there is to be no <term ref="#t346" type="subject">pogrom</term>, no
					violence, no brutality, but <term ref="#t1173" type="subject">they must go</term>. Until a place is found for <pb
						facs="R 6456-27 (210).jpg" n="6"/> them and an arrangement is made for them to get there they will probably have a hard time.
					As to the others, the 800,000 who have established their <term ref="#t1147" type="subject">citizenship</term>, the <term
						ref="#t948" type="subject">Government</term> points to their <term ref="#t1147" type="subject">citizenship</term> as a
					guarantee of the same treatment as accorded to others, although admitting that <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> ‘will
					probably not be admitted to the <term ref="#t943" type="subject">higher positions</term>’. [...]</p>
				<pb facs="R 6456-27 (214).jpg" n="10"/>
				<p>The <term ref="#ehri_dr_nationalities_romanians">Romanians</term> are not, on the whole, a harsh or vindictive <term ref="#t1207"
						type="subject">people</term>; they are, rather, tolerant and easy-going. I feel, therefore, that although the program of
					getting rid of what are termed the ‘surplus’ <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> will probably in any case be retained,
					there is not much likelihood of such a degree of violence or severity being employed as would call down strong <term ref="#t984"
						type="subject">criticism or general protest</term> from the <term ref="#t173" type="subject">outside world</term>.</p>
