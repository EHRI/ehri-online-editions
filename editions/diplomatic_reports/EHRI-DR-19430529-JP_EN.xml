				<p>From Minister <persName ref="#ehri_dr_akira_yamaji">Yamaji Akira</persName> (<placeName ref="#sofia">Sofia</placeName>, <placeName
						ref="#republic-of-bulgaria">Bulgaria</placeName>) </p>
				<p>To: Foreign Minister <persName ref="#ehri_dr_mamoru_shigemitsu">Shigemitsu Mamoru</persName> (<placeName ref="#tokyo"
						>Tokyo</placeName>)</p>
				<p><q>Concerning the <term ref="#t351" type="subject">Jewish Question</term></q></p>
				<p>Currently there are about 50,000 <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> in this country, of which about 26,000 live in
						<placeName ref="#sofia">Sofia</placeName>. Although they do not appear to have any influence in the <term ref="#t708"
						type="subject">cultural sphere</term>, in <term ref="#t924" type="subject">business</term> (especially commerce) they are
					extremely influential. As a result, there is increasingly the view that something must be done about this. In response to this, In
					the <term ref="#t365" type="subject"> “Law for the Protection of the nation,”</term> promulgated in <date when="1941-01">January
						1941</date>, the <term ref="#t948" type="subject">Government</term> established several articles concerning the Jewish
					population. However, the actual effect was rather limited. As a result, last fall the <term ref="#t948" type="subject"
						>government</term> received full authority to deal with the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term>. </p>
				<p>Consequently, they established a new bureau and required <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> to wear <term ref="#t338"
						type="subject">yellow tags</term>, placed <term ref="#t658" type="subject">limitation</term> on their residence as well as on
					their activities besides business, and their control of <term ref="#t945" type="subject">property</term> 2.6 billion leva etc. The
						<term ref="#t948" type="subject">government</term> pursued a <term ref="#t594" type="subject">policy</term> similar to that of
						<placeName ref="#federal-republic-of-germany">Germany</placeName>. However, such <term ref="#t594" type="subject"
						>policies</term> were not very popular. In January this year the vice speaker of the Parliament and about forty members of the
					Parliament criticized the government measures, leading to the resignation of the vice speaker. (There is rumor that the <term
						ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> spent a lot of money for this). </p>
				<p>Recently many <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> are accused of being involved in terror, <term ref="#t253"
						type="subject">sabotage</term>, spying and other forms of political agitation, and engaging in <term ref="#t1051"
						type="subject">black market</term> that should be called the cancer of Bulgarian <term ref="#t918" type="subject"
						>economy</term>. The <term ref="#t948" type="subject">government</term> came to force <term ref="#t864" type="subject"
						>Jews</term> living in <placeName ref="#sofia">Sofia</placeName> to relocate to local areas because it was not very successful
					to leave the matter to their own will (only 2,600 had <term ref="#t204" type="subject">moved out</term> so far)</p>
				<p> That is to say, the <term ref="#t948" type="subject">government</term> will notify <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term>
					about the destination for their <term ref="#t1173" type="subject">relocation</term> within two to three weeks. After receiving the
					notice the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> must leave the city within three days. Concerning this new measure the
					head of the <term ref="#t774" type="subject">Orthodox Church</term>
					<persName ref="#p000014">Stefan</persName> and others lodged <term ref="#t984" type="subject">protest</term> against and it was
					not very popular in general. The <term ref="#t948" type="subject">Government</term>, however, considers that the city’s <term
						ref="#t917" type="subject">political and economic</term> condition will improve after the expulsion of all of its <term
						ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term>. 12,000 <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> who live in the new territories of
						<placeName ref="#north-macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName ref="#thrace">Thrace</placeName> have been <term
						ref="#t518" type="subject">deported</term> to <placeName ref="#republic-of-poland">Poland</placeName>. (Now the <term
						ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> who live in these new territories are mainly those with foreign <term ref="#t1147"
						type="subject">citizenship</term> and number no more than 6,700.) Although there was a plan to <term ref="#t518"
						type="subject">deport</term> the 10,000 <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> who live in the old territories, as a
					result of the new measure this plan was put on hold. </p>
				<p>Through the intermediary of <placeName ref="#switzerland">Switzerland</placeName>, the <placeName ref="#republic-of-bulgaria"
						>Bulgarian</placeName>
					<term ref="#t948" type="subject">Government</term> has reached an agreement with <placeName
						ref="#united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland">Britain</placeName> to send 5,000 <term ref="#t864" type="subject"
						>Jews</term> to <placeName ref="#palestine">Palestine</placeName>. However, they became entangled in the detailed articles and
					the agreement had not been implemented. </p>
