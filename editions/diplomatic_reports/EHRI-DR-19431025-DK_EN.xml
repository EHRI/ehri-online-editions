				<p>The <term ref="#t542" type="subject">precautions</term> taken against the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> in
						<placeName ref="#kingdom-of-norway">Norway</placeName>, from the beginning, were directed mainly towards <term ref="#t583"
						type="subject">Full Jews</term>. Full Jews are understood as persons whose parents were both of <term ref="#t864"
						type="subject">Jewish</term> descent and persons belonging to the <term ref="#t872" type="subject">Mosaic Faith
					Society</term>. On the other hand, all such persons were also subject to the precautions taken and it did not play any role,
					whether he was <term ref="#t375" type="subject">married</term> to a <term ref="#t373" type="subject">non-Jew</term> or in a
					marriage to a non-Jew with children. Exceptions to this rule were probably, both so that some <term ref="#t374" type="subject"
						>Half-Jews</term> may have been <term ref="#t518" type="subject">deported</term>, and so that <term ref="#t864" type="subject"
						>Full-Jews</term>who have been married to non-Jews have been allowed to stay in the country. Thus, in three <term ref="#t496"
						type="subject">Concentration Camps</term> in Norway, there are various <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term>, all of
					whom are full Jews. Of these camps, <placeName ref="#tonsberg">Tønsberg</placeName> with approx. 50 <term ref="#t483"
						type="subject">interned</term> was the largest. Interned half-Jews are found in <placeName ref="#l952" type="camp"
						>Grini</placeName>, but these are not interned because of their descent, but because charges of some kind have been raised
					against them.</p>
				<p><term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> who are Norwegian citizens have been interned on the <term ref="#t594" type="subject"
						>request</term> of the Germans, but on the other side, the Germans have agreed that no more <term ref="#t575" type="subject"
						>deportation</term> will take place from <placeName ref="#kingdom-of-norway">Norway</placeName> of <term ref="#t864"
						type="subject">Jews</term> who are <placeName ref="#kingdom-of-norway">Norwegian</placeName> citizens. Furthermore, the German
					authorities have agreed to disregard wealth <term ref="#t584" type="subject">confiscation</term> in cases where a <term
						ref="#t864" type="subject">Jewish</term> man is detained in a concentration camp or deported, and a non-<term ref="#t864"
						type="subject">Jewish</term> wife must now seek self-employment.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> over the age of 65 are set free.</p>
