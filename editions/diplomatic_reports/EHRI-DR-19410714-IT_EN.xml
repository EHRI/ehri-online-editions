				<p><!--Report of <date when="1941-07-14">14 July 1941</date> from the envoy in Sofia, Massimo
        Magistrati, to the Foreign Ministry. The report was forwarded on 4 August 1941 by Division
        AG IV to the General Directorates Demography and Race and Public Security.</p>
      <p>R. Legation of Italy, Sofia</p>
      <p>Class.</p>
      <p>Cable No. 2832/855--></p>
				<p>Addressed to R. <orgName ref="#g005042">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</orgName>, <placeName ref="#rome">Rome</placeName>.</p>
				<p>Sofia, <date when="1941-07-14">14 July 1941</date>, XIX</p>
				<p>Re: <term ref="#t335" type="subject">Anti-Semitic measures</term> in <placeName ref="#republic-of-bulgaria"
					>Bulgaria</placeName></p>
				<p>The <term ref="#t335" type="subject">measure</term>s officially and publicly taken by the <orgName ref="#g004295">Bulgarian
						Government</orgName> against the <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Semitic element</term> with the <term ref="#t335"
						type="subject">law</term> of last October have recently seen a further step-up.</p>
				<p>Last June the <orgName ref="#g004295">Government</orgName> here issued an order whereby <term ref="#t864" type="subject"
						>Jews</term> may not leave their homes after 9 pm and before 6 am.</p>
				<p>A further decree of <date when="1941-06-26">26th June</date> forbids people of the Jewish race to own and use <term ref="#t849"
						type="subject">radios</term> and telephones. All such devices, several thousands, were handed in to the Postal Authority,
					ostensibly so that they could be checked to see if they worked as transmitters as well, but actually they were not returned.</p>
				<p>Lastly, today the law of which I enclose a translated copy has been published, whereby the <orgName ref="#g004295">Bulgarian
						Government</orgName> levies on all <term ref="#t887" type="subject">property</term>, whether movable or real, owned by people
					of the Jewish race, exempting only property having a total net worth lower than 200,000 leva, a 20% <term ref="#t1047"
						type="subject">duty</term> on property worth up to 3,000,000 leva and a 25% <term ref="#t1047" type="subject">duty</term> on
					property worth over that amount.</p>
				<pb facs="EHRI-DR-19410714-IT_02.jpg" n="2"/>
				<p>As stated in Art. 3 of this law, the <term ref="#t1047" type="subject">duty</term> has to be paid both by <term ref="#t864"
						type="subject">Jews</term> having <placeName ref="#republic-of-bulgaria">Bulgarian</placeName>
					<term ref="#t1147" type="subject">citizenship</term> and by <term ref="#t1149" type="subject">foreign</term>
					<term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term>, whether settled or not in the Country, who own movable or real property in
					Bulgaria.</p>
				<p>A delegation of <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Israelite</term> fellow-citizens who live here came to the R. Legation to invoke
					protection, in order to be exempt from the said extraordinary contribution.</p>
				<p>However, the <term ref="#ehri_dr_italo_bulgarian_trade_and_navigation_treaty" type="subject">Italo-Bulgarian Trade and Navigation
						Treaty</term> of <date when="1934">1934</date>, which is still in force and, as we know, contains settlement clauses in favour
					of the <term ref="#t1147" type="subject">citizens</term> of one Country in the other, stipulates (Art. 5) in the matter of
					internal <term ref="#t1047" type="subject">taxation</term> that they shall receive the same treatment as nationals.</p>
				<p>It would seem, therefore, that there cannot be on our part any intervention grounded in law, aimed at obtaining for the <term
						ref="#t864" type="subject">Israelite</term> fellow-citizens residing here an exemption from the extraordinary contribution
					required by the said law.</p>
				<p>In any case, the issue has a scope that goes beyond the economic aspect.</p>
				<p>I therefore beg the Ministry to let me know, in view of some action that may be undertaken, how we treat <term ref="#t1149"
						type="subject">foreign</term> Israelites in the matter of contributions like the one decreed today by the <orgName
						ref="#g004295">Bulgarian government</orgName>, and to advise me, moreover, if <term ref="ehri_dr_nationalities_bulgarians"
						type="subject">Bulgarian</term>
					<term ref="#t864" type="subject">Israelites</term> have been affected or not by similar measures.</p>
				<p>Magistrati</p>
