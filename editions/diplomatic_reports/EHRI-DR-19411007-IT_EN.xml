				<p>Re: Harsher <term ref="#t542" type="subject">measures</term> against <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> in the <placeName
						ref="#l64">Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia</placeName>.</p>
				<p>Following a decision by the Representative of the <orgName ref="#g001395">Reichsprotektor</orgName>, further important measures
					against the Jews and their sympathizers have been taken and were made known by the Chief of the <orgName ref="#g350">Security
						Police</orgName> by means of a letter sent to the <ref
						target="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-jewishcouncil-organisation-jmp-3749">Protectorate’s Ministry of
						Interior</ref>.</p>
				<p>The attitude of the <term ref="#t872" type="subject">Jews in Prague</term> and in other towns of Bohemia and Moravia was judged to
					have been provocative immediately after the badge with the <term ref="#t338" type="subject">yellow star</term> was introduced,
					before and after the recent developments in the local situation.</p>
				<p>It is true that they ostentatiously displayed their badge and walked in the streets in great numbers, giving the impression, as I
					have already reported, that they felt reciprocal <term ref="#t297" type="subject">support</term> with the local population.</p>
				<p>The letter of the Chief of the Security Police to the Ministry of Interior has not been published in full, but the main measures
					that have been decreed are reportedly the following:</p>
				<p>1)<space rend="tab"> </space>All <term ref="#t758" type="subject">synagogues</term> and all Jewish prayer rooms are to be
					closed.</p>
				<p>2)<space rend="tab"> </space>The compulsory wearing of the yellow star is to be extended to some <term ref="#t544" type="subject"
						>categories of Jews</term> who are not required to wear it in the Reich.</p>
				<p>3)<space rend="tab"> </space>All Jews are threatened with <term ref="#t552" type="subject">removal from the towns</term>, <pb
						facs="EHRI-DR-19411007-IT_02.jpg" n="2"/> presumably in order to collect them in <term ref="#t496" type="subject"
						>concentration or labour camps</term>.</p>
				<p>4)<space rend="tab"> </space>Members of the <orgName ref="#g412">State Police</orgName> have been instructed to act <q>against all
						those who in the street or in public establishments should with ostentatious <term ref="#t297" type="subject"
							>friendliness</term> associate with Jews wearing the star.</q></p>
