				<p><!-- <persName ref="#_1">North Winship</persName>, Proposals looking to <term ref="#t335" type="subject">anti-Jewish
          legislation</term>, <placeName ref="#warsaw">Warsaw</placeName>, <date when="1939-01-27">January 27, 1939</date>, p. 1-3, 5-6. National Archives II, RG 59, Records

				<p>I have the honor to refer to despatch No. 866, dated <date when="1938-12-27">December 27, 1938</date>, which in the last paragraph
					on page 2 mentions the growing tendency among certain politicians to enact <term ref="#t335" type="subject">anti-Jewish
						legislation</term>, and to report that this <term ref="#t956" type="subject">movement</term> is gaining momentum. In fact, at
					the beginning of the present budget session of the <orgName ref="#ehri_dr_parliament_polish">Parliament</orgName> early in
					December, Deputy <persName ref="#ehri_et_stoch_franciszek">Stoch</persName> informed the <term ref="#t1068" type="subject"
						>press</term> that he had worked out a concrete proposal embodying <term ref="#t335" type="subject">anti-Jewish
						legislation</term> which he wished to present. […]</p>
				<pb facs="EHRI-DR-19390127_EN2.jpg" n="2"/>
				<p>Deputy <persName ref="#ehri_et_stoch_franciszek">Stoch</persName> project is based not so much on <term ref="#t328" type="subject"
						>racial</term> but on <term ref="#t592" type="subject">religious principles</term> and proposes the extension of only
						<q>temporary <term ref="#t659" type="subject">citizenship</term></q> [sic] to all professed <term ref="#t864" type="subject"
						>Jews</term>, including even those who changed their <term ref="#t724" type="subject">religion</term> as far back as <date
						when="1918">1918</date>. Under his project these <q>temporary citizens</q> would <term ref="#t659" type="subject">lose</term>:
					Their <term ref="#t1059" type="subject">political rights</term>, <term ref="#t897" type="subject">Employment in public service
						institutions</term> and <term ref="#t1134" type="subject">schools</term>, with the exception of <term ref="#t879"
						type="subject">Jewish private schools</term>, Title to <term ref="#t1086" type="subject">military service</term>, Right to
					handle <term ref="#t897" type="subject">public service</term> supplies, Right to perform licensed professions, Right to publish
					and collaborate in <placeName ref="#republic-of-poland">Polish</placeName>
					<term ref="#t1068" type="subject">press organs</term>, Right to own and operate advertising offices.</p>
				<p>Furthermore the <term ref="#t950" type="subject">bill</term> provides that pensions and <term ref="#t941" type="subject"
						>insurance</term> fees paid up to date by these citizens would be returned to them. Full <term ref="#t1059" type="subject"
						>citizenship rights</term> would be enjoyed only by <term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term>
					<term ref="#t803" type="subject">converted to Christianity</term> before the restoration of <placeName ref="#republic-of-poland"
						>Poland’s</placeName> independence, as well as <pb facs="EHRI-DR-19390127_EN3.jpg" n="3"/>
					<term ref="#t864" type="subject">Jews</term> having special merits because of their <term ref="#t884" type="subject">service
						during the war</term> or because of their outstanding work for <placeName ref="#republic-of-poland">Poland</placeName>.
					[…]</p>
				<pb facs="EHRI-DR-19390127_EN5.jpg" n="5"/>
				<p>As was pointed out in my despatch No. 560 of <date when="1938-01-24">January 24, 1938</date> (<term ref="#t335" type="subject"
						>Anti-Jewish Legislation</term>), it is still true, as was then the case, that the <placeName ref="#republic-of-poland"
						>Polish</placeName>
					<term ref="#t948" type="subject">Government</term> feels that the time is not ripe yet for the enactment of <term ref="#t335"
						type="subject">anti-Jewish legislation</term> as such. However, the significant point in this report is that the tendency and
					trend of <term ref="#t1072" type="subject">public opinion</term> is in that direction. In the meantime the Government still
					endeavors to side-step the main issue, but working through <orgName ref="#ehri_dr_ozon&gt;">OZON</orgName>, continues its <term
						ref="#t594" type="subject">policy</term> of guarded <term ref="#t649" type="subject">discrimination</term>, limiting <term
						ref="#t864" type="subject">Jewish</term> activity wherever possible without direct <term ref="#t328" type="subject"
						>racial</term> reference. Temporizing in this manner, the <term ref="#t948" type="subject">Government</term> hopes to avoid
					hostile <term ref="#t1022" type="subject">foreign censure</term>, placate <term ref="#t329" type="subject">anti-Jewish</term>
					circles here, and not to arouse Jewish apprehension or enmity. The <term ref="#t948" type="subject">Government</term> is under no
					illusion, however, but that eventually this issue will have to be faced squarely.</p>
