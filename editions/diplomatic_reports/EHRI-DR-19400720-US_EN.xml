				<p>I have the honor to report that <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities?q=Ambassador" type="subject"
						>Ambassador</term>
					<persName ref="#ehri_dr_stoica_vasile">Stoica</persName>, formerly <term
						ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities?q=Ambassador" type="subject">Ambassador</term> at <placeName ref="#ankara"
						>Ankara</placeName> and now Under <term ref="#ehri_dr_secretary_of_propaganda" type="subject">Secretary of Propaganda</term>,
					told me the other evening at dinner at my house in honor of himself and the representatives of the <placeName ref="#united-states"
						>American</placeName>
					<term ref="#t1069" type="subject">newspapers</term>, that his <orgName ref="#g1374">Government</orgName> was going to do
					everything within its power to prevent <term ref="#t345" type="subject">anti-Jewish outbreaks</term>, but that it greatly feared
					such <term ref="#t345" type="subject">outbreaks</term> on the part of the <term ref="#t1076" type="subject">Army</term> as the
					latter was so incensed at the treatment meted out to it by the <term ref="#t896" type="subject">Jews</term>
					<pb facs="R 6456-39 (09)" n="2"/> in <placeName ref="#bessarabia">Bessarabia</placeName> when it was withdrawing. I observed that
					for once <placeName ref="#romania">Rumania</placeName> had a good <term ref="#t1068" type="subject">press</term> in the outside
					world, where there was great sympathy because it had been set upon by a powerful nation of 180,000,000 people, and that I thought
					it would be a great pity to sacrifice this for the sake of a <term ref="#t346" type="subject">Pogrom</term> or two.</p>
				<p>On another recent occasion I had an opportunity informally to emphasize to <term ref="#t1003" type="subject">Prime Minister</term>
					<persName ref="#ehri_dr_gigurtu_ion">Gigurtu</persName> that any internal disturbance, especially <term ref="#t642" type="subject"
						>Jewish persecution</term>, might easily be seized upon by <placeName ref="#union-of-soviet-socialist-republics"
						>Russia</placeName> as an excuse for further action. [...] The <persName ref="#ehri_dr_gigurtu_ion">Gigurtu</persName> group
					maintains that to pass rigid <term ref="#t335" type="subject">laws against Jews</term> at the <pb facs="R 6456-39 (10)" n="3"/>
					present critical moment would seriously affect the <term ref="#t1429" type="subject">economic structure</term> of the State, as
					well as create a most unfortunate <term ref="#t1072" type="subject">impression</term> among nations abroad, particularly the
						<placeName ref="#united-states">United States</placeName>. Some observers take the view that should there be no further
					pressure from <placeName ref="#hungary">Hungary</placeName> and <placeName ref="#republic-of-bulgaria">Bulgaria</placeName> for
					territorial cession at present the moderate group will win its point and there will be no strong <term ref="#t330" type="subject"
						>anti-Semitic reaction</term> in <placeName ref="#romania">Rumania</placeName>; if, however, the <ref
						target="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/vocabularies/ehri_terms/search?q=Government">Government</ref> is forced to cede more
					territory immediately, a cession for which <term ref="#t1072" type="subject">public opinion</term> has not yet been adequately
					prepared, the <orgName ref="#g454">Iron Guard</orgName> thesis will be more likely to win because the <ref
						target="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/vocabularies/ehri_terms/search?q=Government">Government</ref> will find it necessary to
					resort to <term ref="#t330" type="subject">anti-Semitic agitation</term> as a cloak and counter-irritant.</p>
				<p>In recent days a few mild <term ref="#t337" type="subject">anti-Jewish measures</term> have been announced but nothing to suggest a
					really vicious program. [...] <pb facs="R 6456-39 (11)" n="4"/> I accordingly feel that no really strong <term ref="#t642"
						type="subject">Jewish persecutions</term> are apt to eventuate in the near future except as they may arise out of new
					circumstances created by the evolution of international events or further dissatisfaction in the <term ref="#t1076" type="subject"
						>Army</term>.</p>
